Subject: Re: Idaho Vital Statistics Integrity Act - short window for comments - by Friday, January 24

Richard,

Mr. Smith and Representative Young may wish to consider using my recent court order from Oregon as part of their evidence because a big part of the birth cert argument is the mythical third sex, aka disorders of sexual
development, etc. But most importantly, the court order states my sex change to non-binary was a psychologically harmful legal fiction and that the hormone therapy did not change my sex.

The petition also references my Canadian affidavit and Supreme Court amicus brief.

See the attached documents, and please reach out to me if I can be of assistance in any other manner.

Blessings,

James Shupe

All,

Please meet Steve Smith, an Idaho allied attorney, and Idaho Representative Julianne Young. They have been working on a birth certificate protection bill, to reverse a recent court decision striking
down sex-based birth certificates in Idaho. This will restore the status quo, making Idaho one of four states that require birth certificates to reflect sex, along with Kansas, Ohio, and Tennessee.

Julianne has a short window to receive comments (especially desired from the medical experts).

Matt Sharp provided ADF factual findings for the recitals and some edits. I have accepted his changes; made a few suggested edits of my own, and thus open it up to you all for any input for Julianne
and Steve.

There may be an opportunity for expert testimony, but I leave the details on that to Rep. Young.

Thanks,
