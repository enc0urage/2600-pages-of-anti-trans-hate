Subject: Re: New Florida DSD/Gender Identity Case

Can Liberty Counsel please consider filing something in this case?
If a judge signs this thing, they're going to do major damage in Florida and it's no doubt leading to an effort for an X marker on licenses.

There is only one type of gonadal tissue in Klinefelter syndrome- a testicle! This is NOT intersex. The transactivists are using this male as a pawn.

It looks like gender activists are trying to pull the same scam here in Florida that's going on with the State Department over passports in the ZZyym case.
A male born with Klinefelters syndrome is claiming to be female using gender identity and estrogen.
They want a Florida judge to sign off so they can use it go after Alabama birth certificates. Of course, this case will have profound effects on Florida too.
Born James: " She was born with an extra chromosome, making her “intersex.”

" But because Mayfield was born intersex, she didn’t require surgery, only estrogen."
