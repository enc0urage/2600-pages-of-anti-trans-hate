Subject: Re: Objections to bill- other thoughtss

For suicides attempts and hospitalization after hormonal therapy, the 2019 Branstrom study from Sweden (by way of
Yale, naturally) also showed no improvement (they claimed it for SRS/GAS, but actually failed to show it credibly).
Me, Mike, Miriam and Paul McHugh (lottaâ€™ Mâ€™s there) have a letter to the editor of AJP criticizing the study
that is going through peer review now.
Mike pretty much hit it out of the park with his answer to the 7 Qs.

Here are my thoughts on those items, Fred:
1. Suicide rates go up
Kids who are suicidal need competent mental health care, not sterilization.
The largest study tracking transgender people encompassed the entire population of Sweden over a 30 year period and showed that hormones and sex reassignment surgery still
left people at a 19X higher risk of completed suicide compared to then general population.
The U.K.'s Tavistock GIDS clinic showed that children on blockers reported GREATER self-harm. Girls reported MORE behavioral and emotional problems, greater dissatisfaction with
body.
The latest survey study being touted by the mainstream media [by J Turban] actually shows that puberty blocker use did NOT reduce the risk of inpatient hospitalization for suicide
attempts.
2. Impact economy
[I'll leave this to the econ people]
3. Interferes with doctor-patient relationship
Not everything is permissible within a doctor-patient relationship. The doctor does not have a right to harm a patient. A proper doctor-patient relationship involves full disclosure of
the risks and benefits of a therapy. If the child cannot fully understand the harms of therapy such as sterilization and removal of healthy body parts, then the child is a part of an

unhealthy doctor-patient relationship and the state MUST intervene to prevent harms.
4. Interferes with parental rights
The parent also does not have the right to participate in the harm of their child. The parent is relying on medical evidence that has been rated as low, very low and no quality
evidence in the 2017 Endocrine Society guidelines. The Endocrine Society guidelines in their disclaimer on p. 3895 states clearly that these treatments are NOT standards of care.
The state must intervene to prevent parents from inadvertently participating in the harm of their child because they have received incomplete information on a poorly researched
subject.
5. Parents must give consent â€“ therefore it should be the parent held responsible, not the doctor
The parent provides consent based on a good faith assumption that the doctors are providing the best care possible and have properly weighed the risks and benefits of treatment.
However, the harms that come to a child (e.g. sterilization, permanent disfiguration, heart disease risk, osteoporosis risk, etc.) are the primary result of physicians who have
performed the surgeries or given these medications. Only the doctor can truly comprehend the potential scope of injury, and only they are licensed by the state to prescribe and
perform these procedures. It is not the job of the parent to investigate any and all potential harms of a medication or procedure. It is the duty of a licensed physician. Therefore
the culpability for harms to a patient, falls on the doctor. [Perhaps, similar to a medical malpractice suit].
6. PB are reversible
The effects of Puberty Blockers are NOT reversible. The important time lost for normal development can never be regained.
A key period of bone strengthening is affected putting the child at risk for adult osteoporosis.
A key period of brain development is affected, and many of the risks are unknown because they have not been studied.
The U.K.'s Tavistock GIDS clinic showed that children on blockers reported GREATER self-harm. Girls reported MORE behavioral and emotional problems, greater dissatisfaction with
body.
Also a key time of growing together and interacting with peers and reaching important psychosocial milestones is lost forever.
An analogy: Just imagine you've taken your child out of 6th grade for the entire year. Is the time lost reversible? If you put them back in sixth grade, are they not in class with a
bunch of students who are developmentally younger than they? Can the time lost studying ever be regained? Will the child not be at a disadvantage trying to catch up to the next
grade? Can the important sixth grade experiences with peers ever be the same?
7. Bill is unconstitutional
[Will leave to attorneys and legislators]

Those are the stats I've seen as well. So take away the medical students and residents, and the AMA really isn't the A-MA.
As for it and the others, they are all professional guilds and susceptible to political/ideological/financial manipulation. They are not scientific organizations, and people don't seem
to get that.

AMA membership hovers less than 20% of licensed physicians, actually about 17% of physicians and medical students.
Decades ago, 3/4 of licensed doctors were members. The AMA movement towards accepting doctors killing patients, and infants are patients, has destroyed the membership
over the decades.
The issue will be that a physician is not a consensus doctor if not abiding by AMA affirmation guidelines.

In Tampa, August 2019, the opposing attorneys wrote: "Dr. Hudson is not a consensus physician and clearly harms children."
Although they lost the case, gutting all of Florida's affirmation guidelines, they included 13 medical and psychological organizations including, My God Yes!, the American High
School Counselors Association!
Accept this approach as typical.
