Subject: Re: Objections to bill- other thoughtss

AMA membership hovers less than 20% of licensed physicians, actually about 17% of physicians and medical students.
Decades ago, 3/4 of licensed doctors were members. The AMA movement towards accepting doctors killing patients, and
infants are patients, has destroyed the membership over the decades.
The issue will be that a physician is not a consensus doctor if not abiding by AMA affirmation guidelines.
In Tampa, August 2019, the opposing attorneys wrote: â€œDr. Hudson is not a consensus physician and clearly harms
children.â€​
Although they lost the case, gutting all of Floridaâ€™s affirmation guidelines, they included 13 medical and
psychological organizations including, My God Yes!, the American High School Counselors Association!
Accept this approach as typical.

Brainstorming idea for objections to bill. Others that you think I should prepare for in addition claims that:

Suicide rates go up
Impact economy
Interferes with doctor-patient relationship
Interferes with parental rights
Parents must give consent â€“ therefore it should be the parent held responsible, not the doctor
PB are reversable
Bill is unconstitutional
