Subject: RE: New Florida DSD/Gender Identity Case
In answer to Jamesâ€™ question below, a Florida judgeâ€™s order to â€œchange all legal documentsâ€​ for an MTF male with Klinefelter Syndrome should not be binding in Alabama, but I can see that setting
up a potential challenge regarding comity, full faith and credit, etc., depending on Alabamaâ€™s exact statutory language.
Not sure who besides the Alabama Department of Public Health would have standing here, but I do not think a general member of the public would.
I have reached out to contacts in Alabama, to apprise the Alabama AG of the situation, and suggest their office or the ADPH Office of Counsel look into this case, and potentially send a letter to this judge or
otherwise take action.
If we have a document on Klinefelter Syndrome with the science all footnoted I could forward, that would be helpful.
