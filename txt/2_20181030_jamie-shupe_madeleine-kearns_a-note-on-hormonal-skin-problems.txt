A Note on hormonal skin problems
Attachments: IMG_0901.JPG
One of the things I wanted to share with you is what happened to me after I stopped taking hormones around Sep/Oct 2017 after the problems with the estrogen injections. Basically, what
happened is my skin went crazy. I had intense itching on my scrotum and legs that was unbearable. And I was getting skin growths popping up like the one in the photos. And the solar
lentigos I have all turned really dark. The primary care doctor at the VA thought I had skin cancer and sent me to dermatology at the DC Veterans Affairs hospital.
I don't know if you're talking to any medical folks like, I think his name is Michael Laidlaw, the endo that's often quoted in conservative publications for his opinion on this, but I suspect taking
these antiandrogen drugs and such make permanent changes to your body. It was really like my body couldn't handle going back to full testosterone and it's variants, like I said, my skin just
totally freaked when I stopped taking the drugs.
The weird thing is, after I went back on 5 mg of Finasteride in May, that skin growth on my head started disappearing.
