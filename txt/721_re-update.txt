Subject: RE: update
The key to the entire bill is the language â€œattempting to change or affirm the childâ€™s perception of their sex,â€​ with sex defined as â€œthe biological state of being female or male.â€​
We have to be able to explain the application.
So letâ€™s say we have a teenage girl:
1. She perceives she is a boy.
a. Doctors cannot perform any of the restricted surgical procedures or give restricted meds (PB & cross-sex hormones) that affirm her perception of being a boy.
b. Doctors cannot perform any of the restricted surgical procedures or give restricted meds (PB & cross-sex hormones) that change her perception of being a boy. (Iâ€™m not sure this is applicable.
Thoughts?)
2. She perceives she is a girl.
a. Doctors cannot perform any of the restricted surgical procedures or give restricted meds (PB & cross-sex hormones) that affirm her perception of being a girl. (This scenario would mean there is
congruity between body and mind. Bill is probably not applicable).
b. Doctors cannot perform any of the restricted surgical procedures or give restricted meds (PB & cross-sex hormones) that change her perception of being a girl. (This scenario would mean there is
congruity between body and mind. Bill is probably not applicable).
Please let me know what you think - Fred
