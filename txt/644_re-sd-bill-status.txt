Great news Fred! The mass of people are against puberty blockers for minors. And the rest of the insanity. I have absolutely no doubt. But we must be ready with our arguments

I will turn in the SD bill in about an hour and a half. It will then become a public document. Of the 105 members in the legislature, we ended up with 42 co-sponsoring the bill.
