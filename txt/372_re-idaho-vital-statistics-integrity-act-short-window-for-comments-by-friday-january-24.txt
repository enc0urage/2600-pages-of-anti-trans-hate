Subject: Re: Idaho Vital Statistics Integrity Act - short window for comments - by Friday, January 24

At the end of the day yesterday the newly posted information on the governor's website showed that there are only 30
bills left awaiting action. H500 (Fairness in Women's Sports- protecting biological males from competing in women's
sports) and H509 (The Idaho Vital Statistics Act) are among those which have been left without action. These are
subject to possible veto or signing through the 31st. If they are not been vetoed before 6:33 PM on the 31st they
can become law even if they are not signed. We need to continue letting the governor know that these are important
to us. Thank you.

My sincere apologies to all, but the governor's office decided at around noon today that they had until the 31st to
act on these bills. We now have until the 31st to continue expressing public support!

One more post on time frames: Apparently since H509 was transmitted to the governor before we adjourned, the 5
days still applies. That means that he has until tomorrow afternoon at 2:40 pm to act on it. As of last night he
hadn't addressed it yet.

Fred,
I've wrestled with whether or not I should bite my tongue or in a military-style "after actions review" kinda way, I should chime in with how I saw things play out.
Okay, so first off, I'm grateful for your courage to do this bill because it's a big strike in the right direction. I'm also saddened that you're taking a lot of heat, but that was to be expected
and you knew that was coming going into the fight. All that said, there were, however, in my view some serious problems in, for a lack of a better word, the "campaign" to pass the
legislation. As I stated previously, I thought it was a horribly bad idea to have folks that are still trans-identifying testifying or otherwise involved. You have to consider that if you were to
somehow piss them off, they could turn all of our emails over the ACLU, etc. That was literally like having people testifying "don't do this, even though I'm doing it because it's
lifesaving." And, of course, the argument from your foes was "we can help people like those folks do it even better, and without the surgeries, because we got them young when they
most needed the help." So that was an all-around bad idea. Next up, as I understood it, and please correct me if I'm wrong, but your platform was that you weren't against adults
transitioning. Let's all be honest, there's no such thing as transitioning, and the harm in that approach is it's being complicit in unleashing these folks on females. By condoning the

creation of these trans adults, it's being complicit in allowing them to compete in female sports, invade women's spaces such as bathrooms, locker rooms, homeless shelters, prisons,
the compelled speech, pronoun issues, etc. There's real harm in that and it's something I've stood against even before I desisted.
In the future, I think a better approach in this regard is to say we support adults having autonomy over their bodies but we refuse to participate in the delusion that they've changed sex
because of gender identity or because of the medical treatments. Further, these adults have to take responsibility for the changes they've made to their bodies in regard to how they
navigate society and even the medical system. To be crass, cutting my penis off doesn't warrant me getting into a female bathroom because it's a choice I made as an adult with
autonomy over my body.
So again, Fred, I am truly grateful for your hard work and willingness to do this because it's put the language and framework into place for other states to hopefully be successful. I just
hope they come at it differently.
For those of you that haven't updated my email address yet, please change it to james.shupe.fl@gmail.com
I'm legally back to James now, so it's time to put Jamie to rest, forever. Jamie was a failed medical and psychiatric experiment, nothing more.
Blessings,
James

Thank you for your courage. Though our session in SD is now over and our efforts to protect gender-confused vulnerable children failed, I continue to receive ugly email and social media posts. America needs more
state legislators like you. â€“ Fred Deutsch, South Dakota Rep.
