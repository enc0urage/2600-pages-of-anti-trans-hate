Dr.Leena Nahata, a trans-affirmation advocate endocrinologist in Ohio, decried the use of puberty blockers in hyper-libidinous teenage boys with severe autism because it was
unethical to treat someone who could not consent to it legally while, at the same time, she is pushing for puberty blockers in trans kids in the early stages of puberty. Can't make up this
stuff!

In case it's not on the radar, the same folks arguing for chemical castration in children for the purpose
of gender confirmation are usually against the same thing being used on sex offenders. The treatments are
one and the same.

Exactly.
And even in the case of something like cancer, any sterilization is a side effect, rather than a
goal, of a treatment for other purposes. There's no directive that children with cancer must be
sterilized, and if doctors could prevent that outcome, surely they would. For no other type of
child is that considered a humane end goal of treatment.

Puberty and a child’s biological sex are not a disease. They are part of normal human

Fred and all,
CPR-C can prepare a rebuttal this week to the ACLU that Mary (UCAL
Berkely), Jane Robbins (Harvard Law), and I (Harvard Law, Guardian ad Litem
for children) can sign and send. I can ask Kara Dansky (former ACLU
lawyer) of Womens Liberation Front if she’d be willing to sign from the
left. Mary’s email re: involuntary sterilization would be key part of the
response. We also need to stress the point the the ACLU is entirely
missing the point of this bill — it nothing to do with discriminating
against any class of children, but rather everything to do with
protecting a vulnerable group of children, and all children (given the
social contagion). While there may be a constitutional right to refuse to
carry a child to term (under Roe), there is no constitutional right to
chemically and surgically mutiliating one’s healthy body, where there is no
disease to be treated — that is child abuse.
When would you need this?

Yes, and also point out that these procedures amount to involuntary sterilization of minors. They
cannot legally or psychologically consent. Their parents cannot give informed consent since the
knowledge necessary for informed consent does not exist. The Supreme Court struck down laws
providing for sterilization of serial criminals in Skinner v. Oklahoma and mentally incompetent adults
cannot be sterilized even if their guardians consent without a court order. Are the ACLU and similar
groups advocating for involuntary sterilization of children? Also their equal protection arguments are
without merit. " Transchildren" are not being treated differently from other children. In fact the
opposite is true. This bill will ensure that "transchildren" have the same protections from dangerous
medical experiments as do other children.

No doctor or parent has a right to subject a child to a lifealtering medical experiment with unknown long-term
consequences. Without this ban in place, SD will follow what is
already happening in other states: minors who successfully sue
in court to obtain this supposedly "life-saving" medical
intervention. And when they grow up with irreversible regret,
who will be liable? The state.
This ban is also important to prevent custody battles. We have
several parents who have reached out to the KC because of a
former spouse who is intent on medicalizing their child. Finding
an attorney to help is nearly as difficult as finding a therapist.
And even when they do, who knows how a judge will rule?
Banning these procedures will take these serious medical
decisions away from misinformed judges.
The claim that this is lifesaving medically necessary intervention
is the big unchallenged domino that is driving both the legal and
medical scandal. This is an oft-repeated claim with no support
and it must be confronted directly.
