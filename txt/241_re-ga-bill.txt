Beloved Warriors,
The so-called â€œSAMHSA reportâ€​ has to come down before the campaign against training kids. This has been on the
website of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration since the Obama administration. I have the
connection to the connection to get it taken down as soon as I have 3 scientific errors in it, especially if they
are about transgenders.
Letâ€™s roll.

Truth is arising in Georgia! Representative Earhart, with whom Jane Robbins and I met a couple of weeks ago,
released this press statement today. She is filing our bill this legislative session in Georgia.
Kudos to Quentin, who makes a powerful statement in support of this bill right out the starting gate! You
all should know that Ginny (Rep. Earhart) beat her Democratic opponent last year in a very purple district
within the city limits of Atlanta who was a trans-activist parent campaigning on this issue. Ginny stood
passionately and courageously on the truth and beat her. She is a fantastic God-choice to carry this bill
forward. And sheâ€™s working with Fred too.
Am stoked for what God is doing in Georgia â€” including a stall to the trans activist agenda in Pickens
County (weâ€™re on it)! And intercessors are praying. Please add us and Rep. Ginny Earhart to your prayer

teams around the country.
Quentin â€” May need your help on Pickens County - will be in touch.
Blessings to all!
