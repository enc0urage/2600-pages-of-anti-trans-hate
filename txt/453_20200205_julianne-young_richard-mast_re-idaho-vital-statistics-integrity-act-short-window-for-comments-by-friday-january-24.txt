Subject: Re: Idaho Vital Statistics Integrity Act - short window for comments - by Friday, January 24

Will did respond with the following suggestion that we incorporate a summary rather than a quote
as follows:

The society of evidence-based gender medicine has declared that the conflation of sex and
gender in health care is alarming, subjects hundreds of thousands of individuals *to the risk
of* unintended medical harm, and will greatly impede medical research.

However, I'm not sure addresses your fundamental concern.

I agree with removing the SEGM quote from the findings. I do not know if the Society for Evidenced Based Gender Medicine is on our side, to where the quote can be
changed, or not. If they testify, and are on our side, I would be very wary of them saying anything regarding TG, CG or “non-binary,” and perhaps have a conversation with
them to that effect.

I would not want to see anyone on our side intentionally put those terms into the record. Using them surrenders the language. Language frames the debate. If the other
side’s language frames the debate, we lose.
