This is such an important work â€” we are all in your debt for unbending this contorted ideology and articulating
truth! I simply cannot wait to read it â€” and USE it.

Hola, Team SD.
I worked with Michelle Cretella and a law professor at request of Alliance Defending Freedom to get out this
amici for the SCOTUS Harris Funeral Home case. We directly took on the AMA and friends amici, which was not
that hard to disprove, IMHO. Itâ€™s the best I think weâ€™ve ever done, though admittedly the others were
Circuit Court cases and not SCOTUS. The law professor requests that his name be kept out of communications
involving this, as he is job hunting right now. I and Michelle are the primary researchers and therefor
authors anyway, and conveniently our names do not appear on it (such is how group projects often go and so be
it). Donâ€™t fear the page count, citations run up through page 18.

Also, my CMDA blog from yesterday seems to be on fire already, reprint approval requested by Christian Post,
several bloggers already posted, other cool stuff, etc.
