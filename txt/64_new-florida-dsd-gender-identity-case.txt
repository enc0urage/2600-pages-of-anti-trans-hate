Subject: New Florida DSD/Gender Identity Case
It looks like gender activists are trying to pull the same scam here in Florida that's going on with the State Department over passports in the ZZyym case.
A male born with Klinefelters syndrome is claiming to be female using gender identity and estrogen.
They want a Florida judge to sign off so they can use it go after Alabama birth certificates. Of course, this case will have profound effects on Florida too.
Born James: "She was born with an extra chromosome, making her “intersex.”
"But because Mayfield was born intersex, she didn’t require surgery, only estrogen."
