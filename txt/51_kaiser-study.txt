Quentin and All,
Here is recent and truly excellent research on trans children and minors among Kaiser-Permanente members in
Georgia, northern CA, southern CA.
From a presentation I just gave at the conference of the Society of Catholic Social Scientists, Oct. 29,
2019, Steubenville, Ohio (held at Franciscan University):
Recommended messaging for Georgia:
Kaiser-Permanente studied non-conforming gender identity in its members from 2006 to 2014. It found that 70%71% of adolescents (ages 10-17) who later identified as gender non-conforming had high rates of other
psychiatric diagnoses prior to first evidence of gender non-conformity, and most of those (60-66%) were in
force during the 6 months before onset of gender non-conformity. Prevalence [prevalence ratios] of these
diagnoses, and of hospitalizations for these disorders, compared to gender conforming boys and girls, mostly
ranged from moderate to astronomically sky high. Children (ages 3-9) who later became gender non-conforming
had a similar pattern of higher prevalence for lifetime disorders and 6-month-before-onset diagnoses, but in
lower absolute numbers. Some children did not have other psychiatric disorders. Kohlberg said children are
simply still developing their concept of gender identity up to age 7.
Over the 8 years of the study, from 2006 to 2014, the number of gender non-conforming minors rose 800% in
Georgia.

Additional information:
(Number of TGNCs roses 1100% in northern CA, southern CA was between northern CA and Georgia).

This retrospective and prospective, longitudinal study used the complete set of electronic medical records
for an entire cohort of Kaiser-Permanente members at three sites (Georgia, northern California, and southern
California) for the years 2006 - 2014.
It may be the first research that found onset dates of psychiatric disorders and first evidence date of
gender non-conforming identity.
There were 427 TF (bio Ms) and 655 TM (bio Fs) children and adolescents = 1,082 GNCs (gender identity nonconformers means TFs + TMs).
(TF = trans female/bio male; TM = trans male/bio female)
Each was matched to 10 controls of the same bio sex + 10 of opposite bio sex.
