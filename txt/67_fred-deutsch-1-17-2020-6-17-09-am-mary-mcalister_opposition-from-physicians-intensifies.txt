Subject: Opposition from physicians intensifies

Passing along email from a pediatrician that was sent to all SD lawmakers. I asked Michelle to please pen a response so I can forward it to lawmakers. If any of the rest of you physicians feel
moved to respond, it will help the cause, as I will also forward to them. Lawmakers on the fence are moved by letters like this as it appears to come from an evidence-based perspective. We
need to be able to provide reasonable rebuttals. â€“ Rep. Fred Deutsch
I am a Pediatrician and community member in South Dakota. I am writing today about my concerns about HB 1057, a bill that would criminalize doctors for performing gender-affirming, lifesaving medical care for transgender youth in our state.
The bill undermines my Hippocratic Oath that I took when I became a doctor, First Do No Harm. Current standards of care for transgender youth and adolescents delays puberty until children
are old enough to make their own decisions about their lived gender. This bill would take away their choices, irreversibly force them through puberty and undermine the prevailing
recommendations of every major medical association. The best practice in Pediatrics is for transgender and gender diverse individuals to have access to comprehensive, gender-affirming,
and developmentally appropriate health care. This bill goes against evidence-based practice and discriminates against a vulnerable population. It puts children's safety at risk, as transgender
youth have increased risk of social isolation, suicide, homelessness, physical violence, and substance abuse, particularly when their gender identity is not supported.
I implore you to vote against this bill, or if you are supporting it, reconsider your position. I also encourage you to get in contact with local physicians treating these youth, to continue the
conversation about how this bill will negatively affect the children that we serve.
Myself, and several other physicians will be at the Capitol on Wednesday, January 22, for Childrenâ€™s Day at the Capitol. I invite you to come to our catered breakfast in the President and
Speaker lobbies starting at 7:00 am, to have the opportunity to talk and ask questions about childrenâ€™s health.
