In the meantime, this is from a friend:
“Fantastic! Tell him thank you from me and all the other moms with kids in therapy for anxiety and depression who live in fear for our kids bc of this. His voice is so important and a great comfort to us.”

Thank you Jamie, for everything. It’s hard for me to engage on email during the day because of my employment. I will be sure to respond more fully later.
I understand your issue with SS. I don’t know the answer but I will think more carefully about it. I know some First Amendment experts.

Hi Kara,
Please reach out for anything that I can be of assistance with.
On the same token, I've been looking for some legal help over Social Security forcing me to identify my male sex as a gender since I've desisted. If you can point me anywhere on that It
would be greatly appreciated. I'll forward the documents.
Looking forward to speaking with you.
Jamie

Hi Jamie,

So great to connect with you just now on Twitter. CC'd on this email is my friend Kara Dansky who coordinates media for and is on the board of Women's Liberation Front. She is an
attorney here in Washington, DC, was one of the feminists on the Heritage panel in late January that you referenced in your recent interview with Laura Ingraham, and is one of the most
articulate people I know who gets the gender identity issue inside and out, especially as it pertains to law and public policy.
The article you penned in the Daily Signal this week was quite compelling. I'll be sending you a subsequent email, but I'll let you and Kara take it from here and chat.
Best,
Brandon Showalter
