MENTAL HEALTH/CO-MORBIDITIES IN GENDER DYSPHORIA
1. THEY ARE PRESENT AND THERE CAN BE MANY.
2015 Finlandâ€™s gender identity services

Â· â€œ75% of adolescents [assessed] had been or were currently undergoing child and adolescent psychiatric treatment
for reasons other than gender dysphoriaâ€​

Â· 26% had an autism spectrum disorder

Â· 87% were female, far disproportionate to past ratios of F:M.
(Kaltiala-Heino R, Sumia M, TyÃ¶lÃ¤jÃ¤rvi M, Lindberg N. Two years of gender identity service for minors:
overrepresentation of natal girls with severe problems in adolescent development. Child and Adolescent Psychiatry
and Mental Health (2015) 9:9.)

2018. Lisa Littmanâ€™s parental survey of Rapid Onset Gender Dysphoria:

Â· 62.5% of gender dysphoric adolescents had â€œa psychiatric disorder or neurodevelopmental disability preceding the
onset of gender dysphoriaâ€.
​

Â· â€œMany (48.4%) had experienced a traumatic or stressful event prior to the onset of their gender dysphoria.â€​

Â· 83% female.

Â· 12.3% prevalence of autism spectrum disorder.
(Littman, L. â€œRapid-onset gender dysphoria in adolescents and young adults: A study of parental reports,â€​
journals.plos.org, Aug. 16, 2018. https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0202330)

2014: â€œ83 patients requesting sex reassignment surgery (SRS) were assessed for DSM-IV Axis I disorders. 62.7% has
one or more.â€​ (Major depression, phobias, and adjustment disorders were the 3 most common).
â€œConsistent with most earlier researches, the majority of patients with gender dysphoria had psychiatric Axis I
comorbidity.â€​
(Mazaheri Meybodi A, et al. â€œPsychiatric Axis I Comorbidities among Patients with Gender Dysphoria.â€​
Psychiatry J, 2014, Article ID :971814. doi: 10.1155/2014/971814.)

2014. Four nation European study found â€œPeople with gender identity disorder show more psychiatric problems than
the general populationâ€¦â€​
â€œNearly 70% had â€œa current and lifetime diagnosis.â€​
(Heylens G, et al. â€œPsychiatric characteristics in transsexual individuals: multicentre study in four European
countries,â€​ The British Journal of Psychiatry Feb 2014, 204 (2) 151-156; DOI: 10.1192/bjp.bp.112.121954.)

Meybodi et al. 2014a,b) reported generally similar results (see Supplemental Table 1): Most found about a 30â€“40%
prevalence of current comorbid psychopathology and about a 50â€“80% prevalence of lifetime comorbid psychopathology
in adults with GD, including a 20â€“60% prevalence of personality disorders.â€​
(Zucker, KJ, et al. Gender Dysphoria in Adults. Annu. Rev. Clin. Psychol. 2016. 12:217â€“47.) (P. 227.)

Personality Disorders
Iran. 2014. Among people requesting sex reassignment surgery (SRS): â€œThe frequency of personality disorders was 81.4%. The most frequent
personality disorder was narcissistic personality disorder (57.1%)â€¦ The average number of diagnoses was 3.00 per patient.â€​

AUTISM

A 2015 survey of adolescents applying for sex reassignment surgery (SRS) in Finland found 26% had an autism spectrum
disorder

Â· 87% were female, far disproportionate to past ratios of F:M ratio.
(Kaltiala-Heino R, Sumia M, TyÃ¶lÃ¤jÃ¤rvi M, Lindberg N. Two years of gender identity service for minors:
overrepresentation of natal girls with severe problems in adolescent development. Child and Adolescent
Psychiatry and Mental Health (2015) 9:9.)

Dr. Lisa Littmanâ€™s study of adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with rapid-onset gender dysphoria found a 12.3%
prevalence of autism spectrum disorder.
(Littman L. Rapid-onset gender dysphoria in adolescents and young adults: a study of parental reports. PLoS One.
2018;13(8):e0202330.)

Almost 8% of children and adolescents referred to the Netherlandsâ€™ multidisciplinary clinic for gender dsyphoria
in this age group had autism spectrum disorders (ASD).
(de Vries AL, Noens IL, Cohen-Kettenis PT, van Berckelaer-Onnes IA, Doreleijers TA. Autism spectrum disorders in
gender dysphoric children and adolescents. J Autism Dev Disord. 2010;40(8):930â€“936. doi:10.1007/s10803-0100935-9.)
A UK survey of self-reported gender identity found, â€œIndividuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or meeting
the AQ [Autism Spectrum Quotient] cut-off score for ASD were over-represented in both the transgender and nonbinary
groups.â€​

Psychiatry, Volume 61, 17 â€“ 22. )

UK. An 18-month review of authorsâ€™ cases at the NHS Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS) Tavistock found the
majority of adolescents presenting with â€œgender identity difficultiesâ€​ also â€œhad an existing diagnosis of an
autism spectrum condition (ASC) or would be likely to obtain one.â€​

​

3. AUTOGYNEPHILIA

â€œSince the beginning of the last century, clinical observers have described the propensity of certain males to be
erotically aroused by the thought or image of themselves as women.â€œ
(Blanchard, Ray. (2005). Early History of the Concept of Autogynephilia. Archives of sexual behavior. 34. 43946. 10.1007/s10508-005-4343-8.)

â€œAutogynephilia is defined as a maleâ€™s propensity to be sexually aroused by the thought of himself as a female.
It is the paraphilia that is theorized to underlie transvestism and some forms of male-to-female (MtF)
transsexualism.â€​
(Balon R (ed): Sexual Dysfunction: Beyond the Brain-Body Connection. Adv Psychosom Med. Basel, Karger, 2011, vol
31, pp 135â€“148 https://doi.org/10.1159/000328921.)

4. ROGD (RAPID ONSET GENDER DYSPHORIA)

Rapid-Onset Gender Dysphoria is the sudden onset of dysphoria during or after puberty with no prior sign of it. Lisa
Littmanâ€™s 2018 survey on this showed a commonality of this occurring in adolescents and young adults (AYAs) where
one or more friends became gender dysphoric or trans-identifying; and whose parents report increasing social media
and web use before it, worsening of their childâ€™s mental health, worsening isolation from family and non-transidentified friends; and distrust of information from non-trans-affirming sources. ROGD has become a social
contagion, as is now self-evident.
(Littman, L. â€œRapid-onset gender dysphoria in adolescents and young adults: A study of parental reports,â€​
journals.plos.org, Aug. 16, 2018. https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0202330)

UK. â€œInquiry into surge in gender treatment ordered by Penny Mordaunt,â€​ thetimes.co.uk, Sept. 16, 2018.
â€œAn investigation has been ordered into why so many girls are seeking gender reassignment after the
number referred for treatment rose by more than 4,000% in less than a decade.â€​
â€œOfficial figures show the number of girls being given gender treatment has risen from 40 in 2009-10
to 1,806 in 2017-18.â€​

Quentin and All,
Here is recent and truly excellent research on trans children and minors among Kaiser-Permanente
members in Georgia, northern CA, southern CA.
From a presentation I just gave at the conference of the Society of Catholic Social Scientists, Oct.
29, 2019, Steubenville, Ohio (held at Franciscan University):
Recommended messaging for Georgia:
Kaiser-Permanente studied non-conforming gender identity in its members from 2006 to 2014. It found
that 70%-71% of adolescents (ages 10-17) who later identified as gender non-conforming had high rates
of other psychiatric diagnoses prior to first evidence of gender non-conformity, and most of those
(60-66%) were in force during the 6 months before onset of gender non-conformity. Prevalence
[prevalence ratios] of these diagnoses, and of hospitalizations for these disorders, compared to

gender conforming boys and girls, mostly ranged from moderate to astronomically sky high. Children
(ages 3-9) who later became gender non-conforming had a similar pattern of higher prevalence for
lifetime disorders and 6-month-before-onset diagnoses, but in lower absolute numbers. Some children
did not have other psychiatric disorders. Kohlberg said children are simply still developing their
concept of gender identity up to age 7.
Over the 8 years of the study, from 2006 to 2014, the number of gender non-conforming minors rose 800%
in Georgia.
Additional information:
(Number of TGNCs roses 1100% in northern CA, southern CA was between northern CA and Georgia).

This retrospective and prospective, longitudinal study used the complete set of electronic medical
records for an entire cohort of Kaiser-Permanente members at three sites (Georgia, northern
California, and southern California) for the years 2006 - 2014.
It may be the first research that found onset dates of psychiatric disorders and first evidence date
of gender non-conforming identity.
There were 427 TF (bio Ms) and 655 TM (bio Fs) children and adolescents = 1,082 GNCs (gender identity
non-conformers means TFs + TMs).
(TF = trans female/bio male; TM = trans male/bio female)
Each was matched to 10 controls of the same bio sex + 10 of opposite bio sex.
