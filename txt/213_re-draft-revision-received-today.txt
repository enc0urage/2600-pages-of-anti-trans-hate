Thanks Fred.

Based on your last email, it will be even more powerful when it reads:

â€œ . . . a mental healthcare professional or medical professional who engages in any of the following practices

â€œdoes not have the normal complement of sex chromosomes of XY chromosomes for a male and XX chromosomes for a
