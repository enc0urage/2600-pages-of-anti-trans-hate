Dear Grace:
I live in the NW section of Portland in the Alphabet District. Either Coffee Time on 21st near 19th or a Starbucks near there at the intersection of 21st and Lovejoy would be great options.
The Starbucks has a parking lot, but there's also ample parking in the neighborhood, although metered.
Please let me know if those options would work for you and what time and day that you would like to meet?
I have a personal website at non-binary dot org if you'd like to get more info about my story and my background.
Thanks!
Jamie
