Subject: Re: ACLU of SD opposes bill that would criminalize medically necessary care for transgender youth
You could pull from our suicide handout (attached again).
Fred â€” You should contact the SD ACLU and ask them for the study(ies) that they base their claim that â€œtransgender youth whose families affirm their gender identity have a 52 percent decrease in suicidal
thoughts, a 48 percent decrease in suicide attempts and significant increases in self-esteem and general healthâ€​. One of our MDâ€™s can then review them and provide refutation of their alleged evidence.
