Yes- this is the article she authored and it was published about the same time she was interviewed in Pediatric News touting GnRH agonist therapy as an accepted practice for trans kids
who have just entered puberty. Thanks for digging around.

It will take some digging because it was in a "throwaway" publication like Pediatric News.

Dr.Leena Nahata, a trans-affirmation advocate endocrinologist in Ohio, decried the use of puberty blockers in hyper-libidinous teenage boys with

severe autism because it was unethical to treat someone who could not consent to it legally while, at the same time, she is pushing for puberty blockers
in trans kids in the early stages of puberty. Can't make up this stuff!

In case it's not on the radar, the same folks arguing for chemical castration in children for the purpose of gender confirmation are usually against the same thing being
used on sex offenders. The treatments are one and the same.

Exactly.
And even in the case of something like cancer, any sterilization is a side effect, rather than a goal, of a treatment for other purposes. There's no
directive that children with cancer must be sterilized, and if doctors could prevent that outcome, surely they would. For no other type of child is that
considered a humane end goal of treatment.

Fred and all,
CPR-C can prepare a rebuttal this week to the ACLU that Mary (UCAL Berkely), Jane Robbins (Harvard
Law), and I (Harvard Law, Guardian ad Litem for children) can sign and send. I can ask Kara Dansky
(former ACLU lawyer) of Womens Liberation Front if she’d be willing to sign from the left. Mary’s email re:
involuntary sterilization would be key part of the response. We also need to stress the point the the ACLU
is entirely missing the point of this bill — it nothing to do with discriminating against any class of children,
but rather everything to do with protecting a vulnerable group of children, and all children (given the social
contagion). While there may be a constitutional right to refuse to carry a child to term (under Roe), there
is no constitutional right to chemically and surgically mutiliating one’s healthy body, where there is no
disease to be treated — that is child abuse.
When would you need this?

Yes, and also point out that these procedures amount to
involuntary sterilization of minors. They cannot legally or
psychologically consent. Their parents cannot give informed
consent since the knowledge necessary for informed consent does
not exist. The Supreme Court struck down laws providing for
sterilization of serial criminals in Skinner v. Oklahoma and mentally
incompetent adults cannot be sterilized even if their guardians
consent without a court order. Are the ACLU and similar groups
advocating for involuntary sterilization of children? Also their equal
protection arguments are without merit. " Transchildren" are not
being treated differently from other children. In fact the opposite
is true. This bill will ensure that "transchildren" have the same
protections from dangerous medical experiments as do other
children.

No doctor or parent has a right
to subject a child to a lifealtering medical experiment with
unknown long-term
consequences. Without this
ban in place, SD will follow
what is already happening in
other states: minors who
successfully sue in court to
obtain this supposedly "lifesaving" medical intervention.
And when they grow up with
irreversible regret, who will be
liable? The state.
This ban is also important to
prevent custody battles. We
have several parents who have
reached out to the KC because
of a former spouse who is
intent on medicalizing their
child. Finding an attorney to
help is nearly as difficult as
finding a therapist. And even
when they do, who knows how
a judge will rule? Banning these
procedures will take these
serious medical decisions away
from misinformed judges.
The claim that this is lifesaving
medically necessary
intervention is the big
unchallenged domino that is
driving both the legal and
medical scandal. This is an oftrepeated claim with no support
and it must be confronted
directly.
