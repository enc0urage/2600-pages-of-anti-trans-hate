Subject: Re: update

Understood, and I know exceptionally good attorneys have gone over and over this. It is very specific to perception of sex, which is good. I also wondered about the need for
such surgeries in trauma victims, but you also specified non-diseased, so that would seem ok. It’s just that if we are a bit confused and have misgivings, one wonders what the
actual legislators will think. Perhaps part of the problem is we were dealing with the longer version for so long that now seeing such a condensed bill seems a touch
bewildering.

The key to the entire bill is the language “attempting to change or affirm the child’s perception of their sex,” with sex defined as “the biological state of
being female or male.”

We have to be able to explain the application.

So let’s say we have a teenage girl:
1. She perceives she is a boy.
a. Doctors cannot perform any of the restricted surgical procedures or give restricted meds (PB & cross-sex hormones) thataffirm her perception of being a boy.
b. Doctors cannot perform any of the restricted surgical procedures or give restricted meds (PB & cross-sex hormones) thatchange her perception of being a boy. (I’m
not sure this is applicable. Thoughts?)
2. She perceives she is a girl.
a. Doctors cannot perform any of the restricted surgical procedures or give restricted meds (PB & cross-sex hormones) thataffirm her perception of being a girl. (This
scenario would mean there is congruity between body and mind. Bill is probably not applicable).
b. Doctors cannot perform any of the restricted surgical procedures or give restricted meds (PB & cross-sex hormones) thatchange her perception of being a girl. (This
scenario would mean there is congruity between body and mind. Bill is probably not applicable).

Please let me know what you think - Fred
