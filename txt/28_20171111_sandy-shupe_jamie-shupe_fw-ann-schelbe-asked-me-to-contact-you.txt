Myself and some of the other local girls see Dr. Charles Yahr for facial electrolysis. It's expensive but he's certified and the best in entire area.
This is a good link to explain the different types:

This shows who is actually certified in Pa.

I never wasted any time of money on laser because it's not permanent hair removal. Some of my friends started laser, but gave it up and have switched to
electrolysis for that reason.
I can seriously relate to being a loner over this. I was myself for most of my life because of being trans and also because of childhood sexual abuse. My transition
involved coming to terms with both. I'm not out to my parents due to their conservative values and advanced age. I actually moved to Pittsburgh from Maryland
to distance myself from family. Same goes for my siblings. It's a big source of pain for me that I'm still coming to terms with. My wife and college age daughter
both know of course, and I'm out in the trans community.
Cattivo is the most popular meeting place for the trans community:

"Garden of Peace Project" does "Transition Thursdays" each Thursday evening at 10 p.m. Most of us that are going to come tend to show up earlier than that.
It's not a big crowd, but a chance to meet people, and the faces change quite often. My wife and I normal get there around 7:30 to 8:00 p.m. Strange, but it's
actually in a residential neighborhood. No parking meters, but sometimes tough late in the evenings, but early arrival is pretty easy to find something.

A large number of people including myself and my wife go to Metro Family Practice and see Dr. Aiken. She's amazing. Treats people so well my wife even
decided to become a patient there for her needs.
If you ever feel the need to talk or ask something anonymously, this is a great place:

Just create a regular or anonymous throwaway id and ask away. Lots of good advice and friendly people there.
That's what comes to mind for now.
Let me know if you want to join us some Thursday evening at Cat's. You can come dressed or in boy-mode, whatever you feel comfortable with.
