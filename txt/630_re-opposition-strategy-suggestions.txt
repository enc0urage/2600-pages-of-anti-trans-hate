Unfortunately, this got cut from my Public Discourse article on Puberty Blockers, but it's another way to think
of the problems they introduce to normal development.
Downstream Events and Unforeseen Consequences
Here is another analogy, this time regarding unforeseen consequences. Imagine a scenario whereby a neighbor asks
you to dig a hole in her lawn.
¨Sure thing!¨ you reply.
¨Great," she says,¨but will it be reversible?¨
¨Certainly," you reply, ¨I'll just fill the hole back in and it will be fine.¨
She smiles and accepts your offer. You grab your shovel and proceed to dig a nice round 3-foot deep hole.
¨What do you think?" you inquire.
¨No, not right,¨ she says. ¨Reverse it for me¨

¨No problem," you say and proceed to fill the hole back in and pack it neatly.
You return home and then are aroused by some loud knocking on the door 20 minutes later. You open the door to
find your irate neighbor.
¨What have you done?" she asks. ¨You said that you would reverse it!¨
¨I did," you respond, "I filled the hole back in right away.¨
¨Well sure...But guess what? You cut my power line! And I was in the middle of an important computer file
download which is now lost. And you broke my water main! And so my radiator has run dry and is now destroyed!!¨
Clearly, although the digging of the hole was reversible, other secondary or ¨downstream" processes were
interrupted leading to unforeseen consequences and damage. This is analogous to the harms that occur when
stopping normal puberty. [Meaning bone develoment, brain devlopment, sexual development, etc].

This video, which isn't exactly a detransition video, is a 24yo FTM talking about the trauma of going through
phalloplasty, and experiencing menopausal symptoms as a very young person, in an interview with two younger FTM
YouTube personalities. The three talk briefly about their concern over influence on their audiences.

I don't know how any full grown person can watch a video like this and not think these young people needed a
pause.

All,
In an earlier email, I talked about how treatment being unavailable because of law would serve as a deterrent, using the example of how kids aren't pestering their parents to drink
because they know the law says they can't until age 21. This excerpt reinforces this.
Page 58: "It is not rare for preoperative transsexuals to abandon their quest for reassignment; it is not well-established that such cases are more likely to involve secondary
transsexuals, but this is what we would predict. Shore (1984) reports the case of a young man who was positive he wanted sexual reassignment, was favorably evaluated for
surgery, and was on his way to the hospital when he learned the hospital had changed their policy and now prohibited sex reassignment surgery. This man, soon thereafter,
changed his entire life-style and reportedly gave up his sex-reassignment plans."
Speaking from experience, this is very impulsive stuff in many cases, and the lowering of barriers in today's environment is creating a far more dangerous landscape. Remember,
I got hormones during my first visit to a mental health provider.

So, for one we are shifting the fight from inside the home with the parents to the state, and two, we are putting up a roadblock to the impulsiveness that's inherently characteristic
with a lot of the co-morbid mental health issues these children have.
