Hi Jamie,
That's one reason I like to get people's email addresses. You never know when the twitter police will make them
disappear...
I believe Madeleine Kearns said she would be writing an article too. So I look forward to reading that.
Very curious about those nuke rounds :)
I'm in contact with a collection of doctors fighting back against what's happening. They wanted to also pass on a
deeply felt message of thanks for being so courageous to speak out. You may know of Dr. Michelle Cretella? She is
one of them. She's done a lot of great work speaking out about the dangers to children.
Ok if I report on Twitter about how you were suspended?

Hello Dr. Laidlaw,
Thanks for the kind words. I'm in Twitter jail today and can't use my account. Twitter locked my account for saying
that gender dysphoria is a mental disorder after someone asked my thoughts on it. It's a 12-hour suspension. I hope
to be back on tonight.
I hope you are well. Thanks to you also for being one of the few brave souls willing to take a stand for these
kids.
I've got some nuke rounds to unload about my court victory. I hope some journalists are going to drop them very
soon.
Jamie
