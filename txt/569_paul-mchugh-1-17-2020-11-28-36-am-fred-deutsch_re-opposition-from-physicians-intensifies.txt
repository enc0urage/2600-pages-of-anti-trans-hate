Subject: RE: Opposition from physicians intensifies
A rather direct debate point here Fred is to note that this pediatrician may think he or she took the Hippocratic oath but must have been partly asleep at the time . Specifically the Hippocratic Oath does not say
â€œFirst Do no harmâ€​ This expression can be found in other Hippocratic writings but nowhere in the Oath. Rather the Oath expressly says that as a doctor â€œI will come for the benefit of the sick, remaining
free of all intentional injustice, of all mischiefâ€​â€​. There is no evidence beyond the level of testimonials from folk with an agenda that the â€œgender affirmingâ€​ proposals this pediatrician would provide
â€œbenefitâ€​ the child or anyone else for that matter and plenty of evidence that itâ€™s mischief. . Keep up the fight! Paul .
