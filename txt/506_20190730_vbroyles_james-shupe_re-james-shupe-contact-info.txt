James
The pleasure was truly mine in hearing and meeting you last week. Thank you for sharing your affidavit with me,
which is really your story. I appreciate (and applaud) your willingness to be of help where a child is involved.
Don’t ever stop being an emotional and gentle man — indeed, isn’t that the essence of “gentleman”.
