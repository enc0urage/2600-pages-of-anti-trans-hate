Fred and Michelle,
I understand. Fred has far and away done the heavy lifting on this fantastic project. I am completely OK following
the lead and rules he establishes. Alliances can be fragile and it’s best that, as this bill goes, we stick to the
small scope program in order to establish the greater goal.
As an aside, we have already seen Scott several times pigeonhole this bill into trans ideology with glowing Pro
trans language, aside from GAT in kids. Again, I think he’s a loose cannon. However , Fred, you know him better than
anyone and I trust your judgment in getting this bill passed into law.

​Dr. Cretella,
I'm going to respectfully disagree with that, and I'll explain why.
I was recruited heavily by the Transsexual Global Alliance and I've largely ignored them.
There's no shortage of transsexuals willing to denounce the medicalization of children, but
their endorsements come with a hitch: they expect everyone to play make believe that they
really are the opposite sex and have compelled pronouns and all that garbage. Even worse,
they pitch themselves as the real deal, the true transsexuals that had to transition.
People like me they claim have sexual paraphilias and fetishes, while they were born in the
wrong body.
So I encourage all of you to not buy into this Trojan Horse ploy, because the actions of
these folks "identifying" as the opposite sex is contributing immensely to the harm being
done to females. It's part of our fight, in fact.
Walt Heyer is proof that no matter how far you've gone medically, you can still turn back.

So unless they've taken formal steps to reclaim their birth sex and denounce gender
ideology, please don't endorse or indulge these persons.
Or contribute to the Blaire White types profiteering from this type of behavior.

8 months ago was the first time I was made aware that they were doing this to

Please dont loose hope or strength toward this goal, this bill is historic if it

I Understand what you are both saying; you are right.
BUT you both made comments to ENTIRE email string - it is not wise to essentially “dis” Scott in front of entire
team when the bill is to be defended in committee Wednesday with Scott’s testimony as part of Fred’s strategy.
Better to have shot me down with Scott out of the string and debated strategy with Fred alone.

I'm quoting Scott here:
"But, if we turn it around after we shut it down and talk to the ADULT TRANSGENDER PEOPLE, like me and say,"
"Listen, some adults need to transition to find peace in their lives. I, we understand that we have a transgender person on our panel. Our opinions don't have anything to
do with being against the transgender community. We have dozens of transgender adults supporting us because they understand the severity of medical transitioning. What we
are saying is that NO ONE has the right to chose to be locked into the medical system, have less than 100% healthy bodies and decide to put themselves there for life than an
adult about their own lives.
Here's how this should be addressed. Even if you can somehow justify the "trans" medical treatments for consenting adults, it's medical malpractice to indulge the delusion that
the person has a gender identity and "affirm" that false identity in your words and actions.
I wrested with: Do I want to say it behind Scott's back or in her face?" Am I correct that Scott is an FTM? And I decided if I wasn't willing to say it in Scott's face, I shouldn't say it
at all.
Scott can be dropped with a simple explanation that endorsing Scott's gender ideology has negative effects on females, example sports, etc.
Again, the ACLU and the AMA are gonna testify that building Scott at a young age is better and healthier, spares the surgeries and produces a better cosmetic product.
