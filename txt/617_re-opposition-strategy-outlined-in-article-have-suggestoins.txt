No doctor or parent has a right to subject a child to a life-altering medical experiment with unknown long-term
consequences. Without this ban in place, SD will follow what is already happening in other states: minors who
successfully sue in court to obtain this supposedly "life-saving" medical intervention. And when they grow up with
irreversible regret, who will be liable? The state.
This ban is also important to prevent custody battles. We have several parents who have reached out to the KC
because of a former spouse who is intent on medicalizing their child. Finding an attorney to help is nearly as
difficult as finding a therapist. And even when they do, who knows how a judge will rule? Banning these procedures
will take these serious medical decisions away from misinformed judges.
The claim that this is lifesaving medically necessary intervention is the big unchallenged domino that is driving
both the legal and medical scandal. This is an oft-repeated claim with no support and it must be confronted
directly.

Mike,
Look at the medical claim in that “legal” ACLU quote; it is false on multiple grounds
“no such thing as a medically diagnosable group of trans anybody; we are talking about minors! blockers, wrong
sex hormones and surgical mutilation are never medically necessary in minors!”

Letâ€™s Memorize Katherineâ€™s response and repeat it ad nauseam regardless the question or accusation. That is the
bottom line here. We must be bull dogs on this fact and principle.
