Subject: Re: Idaho Vital Statistics Integrity Act - short window for comments - by Friday, January 24

Just to expand a bit on the parent argument...it not simply the state being complicit in a legal fiction (that a
girl was actually born a boy), but it is the state compelling an unwilling party to party to that legal
fiction...parents whose legal records state they gave birth to a son when they really gave birth to a daughter.
Haven't had a chance to watch the hearing, but was this argument part of the testimony?

Thank you, Julianne. Have you considered the argument from the parent perspective? When birth certificates are
changed, they create a legal fiction involving unwilling parents: That a mother who gave birth to a daughter gave
birth to a son, and vice versa. As recently as last month, a mother wrote to us expressing absolute shock that her
young adult daughter can change her birth certificate without her permission. As she stated, she and her husband do
not want their names connected to a "blatant lie."
FYI, to encourage people to write to Idaho House members, I tweeted out a link to the bill and the House Members'

The House State Affairs committee sent our bill to the floor on a party line vote with a do-pass recommendation.
We had some great testimony (in opposition) from the National Organization of Women representative, Janelle
Winterstein. Janelle opposed the bill, suggesting that it is uncharacteristic of the acceptance and kindness she
has felt from Idahoans, including many of the more conservative members of the state affairs committee. It seems
that this testimony would be a great benefit should a court be seeking evidence that this bill is motivated by
animus.

Our strongest opposition came from the Lambda Legal Attorney who represented the plaintiffs in F.V. v Barron (a
very tall woman if you're skimming the video looking for her testimony). She countered some of my statements
which suggested that this issue has not been robustly examined based on it's impacts on public policy and the
state generally because the state conceded everything and the arguments make (based on the West Law minutes)
addressed only the interests of the agency and not the public at large. She argued that everything I brought up
had already been heard and considered by the court and that they have already decided this issue. By passing this
bill, we are placing the DHW in a position to be found in contempt of court. This argument, coupled with the
court costs may sway moderate republicans in the House and could stop the bill in the Senate if we don't have a
strong counter-argument on the House floor. It could be up for debate on the floor as soon as next Tuesday and
must be transmitted to the Senate by the end of the week.
The video of the hearing is available
here: https://legislature.idaho.gov/sessioninfo/2020/standingcommittees/HSTA/ . It does take awhile to open. It
was about a 2 hour hearing. There was a very short bill right before mine but it only took a couple of minutes.
Most of the file is our bill.
Counter arguments I am considering include:
The proposed statute complies with the requirement of the injunction in that the statute does not automatically
reject applications to amend this category of material facts, but establishes a process by which those
applications may be reviewed and considered. This process protects the interest of the state in ensuring the
accuracy of material statistics.
The legislature rejects the argument that biological sex is gender identity.
Courts are required to observe the
definitions established in the law. The legislative branch, including on the federal level, has consistently
acted on a biological definition of sex. Yet, this court relied upon the conflation of sex and gender identity in
issuing their ruling. The conflation of these terms in the law severely undermines the compelling interest of the
state and jeopardizes the health and safety of all Idahoans.
Sex specific policies have been upheld by the
courts for decades specifically because of the material distinctions between male and female, statistically
speaking. If we accept the premise that these distinctions are irrelevant, that sex is gender identity
irrespective of biological fact, we must also find that all sex-based distinctions are discriminatory.
I would sincerely appreciate legal feedback and suggestions.

The Idaho Vital Statistics Act will be heard tomorrow morning in State Affairs. Our meetings are usually at 9 but
I won't be surprised if we start at 8 AM. It will be available live online or recorded if any are interested in
listening. We may get some ideas that will help as we head to the Senate.

Does anyone have a contact in the research and statistics world or someone in the insurance industry (medical or
car) that could provide a statement explaining the value of accurate information regarding biological sex as a
qualifying characteristic for sex specific differences in policies, etc? These are research based private
policies. When we fundamentally alter the legal definition of sex we undercut their ability to effectively
implement those research-based policies.

Dear Friends,
Attached below is the draft which we RS'd on Friday. The Lord is blessing our efforts! We anticipate a
print hearing in House State Affairs this Wednesday and a full hearing towards the beginning of next week. I
am working on talking points and a press release. We need to keep our messaging very controlled. Also, I
would welcome input on plans for public testimony at the hearing. I am working on some drafts which I will
post ASAP.

near or at our final draft so that we can work on securing support from the governor's office.
Leadership appears to be supportive so I have good reason to hope we will soon have a hearing. Thank you

In regard to the last question: a colleague who is an attorney suggested that a better approach may be
to stipulate that the physician make a presumptive determination of male or female and that after
undergoing the appropriate combination of genetic analysis and evaluation of the individual's naturally
occurring internal and external reproductive anatomy a signed affidavit from the parents and the
physician may be submitted within 3 years or the presumptive determination may be challenged in a court
as stipulated in (4). This eliminates the potential for an open-ended indeterminate status.
Thoughts on this idea?

My apologies if this is redundant. I have tried to 'reply all' in order to share this with the larger
group but I'm not sure that it worked. If you could ensure that the larger group has access to this
request I would appreciate it. Thanks so much.
Our vital statistics folks in the Department of Health and Welfare have raised some questions which we
have attempted to address in the attached draft. Their comments focused primarily on 39-245A (4) and
(5).
They wanted to ensure that the language stipulated that the affidavit be one provided by the department
and asked that we make some changes in formatting to make the process more clear to the public. I
believe the changes to (4) are straightforward.
They raised some good questions regarding (5) though:
1- Our current language does not require verification from a medical professional that the appropriate
chromosomal analysis and evaluation of anatomy has taken place and that the decision of sex is
appropriate based on that analysis and evaluation.
2- Our language is silent about what happens if they don't resolve the indeterminate status within the
three years. Do we need to specify that it can be resoled in court after this? Do we need to specify
any requirements should that be the case?
The drafter and I took a stab at it in the attached draft.
to those who are providing review on this!

Again, feedback is appreciated.

Thank you

Representative Young
