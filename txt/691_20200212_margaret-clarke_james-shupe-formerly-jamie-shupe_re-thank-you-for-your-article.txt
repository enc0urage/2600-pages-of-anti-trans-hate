I thought I just saw an article that you wrote in Heritage email? No?

Margaret,
I'm not quite sure what you mean by "my article?"
Much appreciated if you could narrow that down some.
Thanks!

Thank you as well, Margaret, for your kind words and support.
I prayed for Fred and the rest of you yesterday that have been willing to take on this big fight.
Fred's facing another hearing today, and I'm proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with all of you on this important
issue. You're not wrong about this, it really is what needs to happen to protect these children and their parents.
Blessings,
James

Good morning James,
Thank you for your precious message of redemption. I am leading a coalition her in Alabama to adopt a bill similar
to Rep. Fred Deutschâ€™s. He and Michelle have been coaching us. You will be on our prayer list. It is so encouraging
to see the genuine work of the Lord in your heart and your courage to admit failure. More importantly that Jesus
Christ is the sole help of you heart and sole. Heart change is the greatest miracle of all!! Your testimony gives
God great glory!!!
Thank you so much,
Margaret
