Howâ€™s it going with getting one consent form?

I am told two or three really good malpractice cases, particularly from minors with regret, and for Jane and
Michael to get so much as one consent form from CH LA or UCSF, and it is game on. It wonâ€™t be long.

Dear Team
After reading about the Oregon Hospital and their gender program, I can not describe the horror that I
personally feel. My mental illness and gender dysphoria came out of a broken home with a drunk for a
father, and a mother who was mentally ill who sexually abused me. The mental torment that I felt
growing up was horrific. GD has played a key part in all of my relationships and life decisions.
To this very day I suffer from the consequences that GD has had on my life. But the doctors I dealt
with were all, uniformly reluctant to allow any individual to pass through the ultimate gate towards
SRS. They all understood it was a last resort for the desperate.
And to think that any medical institution would further and promote the debacle that GD has on young
people is nothing less than vile and despicable in the extreme .
I understand that multiple factors has caused ROGD epidemic. But for anyone in the medical community
to do what Oregon medical community has done is criminal.
How can we stop this? We must stop this. How?

Sincerely

Rene Jax
