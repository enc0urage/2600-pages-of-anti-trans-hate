Subject: Re: Endo Society weighs in

Great idea Quentin! I'm adding Will Malone in the email. He's planning to go to the meeting for 2020 in San Fran.
I'm going to try to be there. At the least this year, we can invade the Q&A and demand answers. Not that I'm
expecting much. But would be good to have them hear some questioning physicians at least.
Just noticed that Rosenthal of UCSF is on the board of directors for Endo Soc. Figures

I emailed each member of the steering committee of the ENDO 2020 meeting (the Endocrine Society's annual CME event) to suggest that they consider a broad, balanced presentation
forum so that all opinions about transgender care could be presented and debated. I was answered in an email from the steering committee chairman that I should provide input to them
sometime in April in planning for ENDO 2021 since they had already set this year's agenda. She listed the three talks planned- all by trans affirmation folks- and told me to look for the
announcement requesting suggestions for ENDO 2021. I asked her to be sure to send me the notice personally since I had never received such a notice in May of 2019 asking for input
about topics for ENDO 2020. Mike- we need to be sure we both get in their face for next year's meeting and not let down.

The Endocrine Society has jumped into the mix. I attached a screen shot.
