Subject: Re: SD Bill status

Natasha: This is great work and a great response to opponents. This is something I have thought about for a long
time, especially being in Virginia and living in the community where Carrie Buck and many others were sterilized
following Justice Holmes' approval of such procedures because three generations of imbeciles are more than enough.
Civil rights advocates have been fighting for years to get reparations for these victims and denouncing the
inhumanity of forced sterilization, and now it is being pushed on children. The hypocrisy of decrying the
sterilization of "undesirables" but pushing sterilization of children should be emphasized.
Thanks for your efforts on this.

What do folks think of this compilation of eugenics references to similar procedures performed on similar
populations, way back when? Any feedback? The format is a little rough, but I'll try to get it in good form for
release by Friday.
One thing to note is that I found multiple references to a federal ban on funding for sterilization for persons
under 21, certainly for those under 18, and a lot of different takes on the once-more-popular view that removal of
the sex organs would improve the mental health of those deemed otherwise incurable.

Agree. Web page is fantastic.
Right now, at least on Twitter no picture accompanies the web page link. Consider talking to your web people Fred about making that happen. There is code that needs to be added to the
web page. If they're not sure how, I can point them to directions on how to do it.
For right now I used a pic of the main clip in my tweet.
