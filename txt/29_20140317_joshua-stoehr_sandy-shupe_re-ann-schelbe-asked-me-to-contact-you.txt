Subject: RE: Ann Schelbe asked me to contact you
Thanks for contacting me! I have been dealing with this since i was little with no one to help but my old neighbors mom. My own parents didn't even know until recently.
I have given up caring what people say so im going for what i need to do. I have no idea where to go or what to do around here. I see Anne and she refereed me to a doctor i will
see on Friday. I also go to Ideal Image for the hair removal, which was refereed to me by my dermatologist. I know zero places to meet people like us, I have been a loner my
entire life because of this. Any info that you wish to send my way would be greatly appreciated!
