Subject: Re: Detransitioner Amici brief for SCOTUS

James, this is much appreciated, and already helpful. I’ve been trying to determine how to approach the whole topic,
and I think you’ve honed right onto it: the dysphoria and suicidality are symptoms of an underlying issue. The
underlying issue needs to be treated. As I work through your references I’ll likely reach out again. My regards,
Will

helpful for your project to be able to browse the details of the many suicides articles I had collected. What I came
to see was a pattern of these kids being plagued by severe mental illness but yet their deaths get used for
activism. A lot of the kids committed suicide even if they were well supported and not bullied.

genderqueer, bigender, and genderfluid. Finally, in the summer before 10th grade, I discovered I was transgender."

than transgender and had recently begun asking people to call them Miriam again."

parents to agree to treatments that they otherwise would not agree to. I would be most appreciative of any written
materials you have on this topic. I’ve got the major long term studies showing no benefits, and stuff from
Transgender trend and 4th wave now.
