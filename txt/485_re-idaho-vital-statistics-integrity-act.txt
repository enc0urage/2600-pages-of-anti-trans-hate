Re: Idaho Vital Statistics Integrity Act

Thank you for the introduction and the kind words of encouragement that keep us all going! Idaho House members
pushed hard to stay the 5 days to be able to over-ride a governor's veto but we lost and our session concluded this
morning. This means that the governor will have 10 days rather than 5 with no legislative counter-balance in play
to sign or veto bills. That 10 days will end on March 30th for H509. Working hard to activate phone calls and
email until then. If anyone has networks interested in supporting, or is interested in making a personal contact
with the governor's office, this next ten days is the time to do it.

Thank you for your prayers and help!

Well said, Margaret.

Also, I would like to introduce Dr. Paul Church to the group. Dr. Church has also been a fighter, even at the cost of his work at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Paul Church <piman71@gmail.com>
