Hello Michelle,
I'm equally honored to meet you as well.
Great news arrived in the mail today. The VA wrote sex change letters confirming that I am male and officially changing me back.
With that, the next move begins. To kill my landmark non-binary court order.
Keep that under your hats, for now, please, though.
Jamie

Hello Michelle and Jamie,
Great pleasure to introduce Jamie Shupe to you Michelle. As you know he wrote the great federalist article and has also been making a lot of noise on Twitter. So they shut him up! For now...
And Jamie, you know Dr. Michelle Cretella, she was also critical in helping us in Rocklin when they were pushing trans madness into our schools. And of course she has so many great writings,
videos, etc.
Mike
