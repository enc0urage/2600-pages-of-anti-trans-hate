Subject: Re: Site Errors
Right now my IP is "Verizon Wireless (70.211.17.142)", but it's an impossible situation for me because I use cellular data as my only Internet source. And my IP changes every time I unplug
and plug my phone in.
I live in an RV, and move frequently, so I use cellular by necessity. But I would think it would be okay to whitelist Verizon wireless ranges, wouldn't it? Isn't it unlikely that cellular is going to be
used to attack because it's metered?
It's expensive, I spend $220 a month with Verizon for their crap. Ugh.
Thanks.
Jamie
