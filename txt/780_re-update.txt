One last suggestion â€” add a definition for â€œmedical professionalâ€​ in Section 1 that includes all the verbiage
on lines 23 and 24, and so can have a clean Section 2 that says: â€œany medical professional or mental healthcare
professional who engages in . . . or who causes them to be performed, for the purpose of . . ."

All, just a note to update you on status of the Vulnerable Child Protection Act.
Iâ€™m comfortable the bill and white paper are at or near final form.
Iâ€™ve begun my road trips across the state to meet with key moderate Republicans. Response has been mixed but mostly positive. Not a single legislator Iâ€™ve spoken with so far has a clue
about whatâ€™s happening with transgender advocacy nor affirmative therapy. All of this is new to them.
Despite the generally positive response, I have no doubt this will be an uphill battle when we get to session. The last time I introduced a transgender-related bill in 2016, the state and the
governor experienced political and economic pressures including boycott threats from around the country. I doubt this time will be any different.
I meet with the governorâ€™s top policy advisor next week to discuss the bill.
Iâ€™ve targeted about 20% of the legislature to meet one-on-one prior to session.
KC from Kelsey Coalition will be developing her suggested strategy for testimony that Iâ€™ll bounce off our South Dakota team.
As always, please do not share this with media. The longer we can fly under the radar, the better.
Please let me know if you have questions. I am grateful for your support and prayers.
