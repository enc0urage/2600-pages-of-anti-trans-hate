Dr. Laidlaw (Mike),
Thank you for your hard work on this article and all the other stuff you've got your fingers into.
I'm retired, so I get to play on the internet all day, but the folks like you and Dr. Malone are taking time out of your days and lives to make a difference for these kids and that doesn't go
unnoticed.
Blessings,
James

All,
I've got a new piece out in the Public Discourse tonight on why the Pediatric Endocrine Society is wrong about puberty blockers being reversible and is ignoring serious harms.

Please read and share widely with legislators, educators, friends family etc.

I think it will help in the intellectual battle when trying to get our important legislation passed in the states.

Thanks

Terrific information, particularly on background to support the position. Thank you for the obviously significant time and thought applied. I'm likely late to this "team", but thanks to Fred and Michelle, am
grateful for all the expertise. There is a small but growing number of us in the Catholic Medical Association who are pushing this issue forward, and this type of information is great help in getting ahead of
it.
