On a useful and related note, my CMDA blog on the parent resource guide to the trans movement is out today.

Truth is arising in Georgia! Representative Earhart, with whom Jane Robbins and I met a couple of weeks ago,
released this press statement today. She is filing our bill this legislative session in Georgia.
Kudos to Quentin, who makes a powerful statement in support of this bill right out the starting gate! You
all should know that Ginny (Rep. Earhart) beat her Democratic opponent last year in a very purple district
within the city limits of Atlanta who was a trans-activist parent campaigning on this issue. Ginny stood
passionately and courageously on the truth and beat her. She is a fantastic God-choice to carry this bill
forward. And sheâ€™s working with Fred too.
Am stoked for what God is doing in Georgia â€” including a stall to the trans activist agenda in Pickens
County (weâ€™re on it)! And intercessors are praying. Please add us and Rep. Ginny Earhart to your prayer
teams around the country.
Quentin â€” May need your help on Pickens County - will be in touch.
Blessings to all!
