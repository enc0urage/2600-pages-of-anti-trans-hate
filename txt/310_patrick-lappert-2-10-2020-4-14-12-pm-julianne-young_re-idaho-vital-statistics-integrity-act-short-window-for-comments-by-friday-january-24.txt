Dear Friends,
Attached below is the draft which we RS'd on Friday. The Lord is blessing our efforts! We anticipate
a print hearing in House State Affairs this Wednesday and a full hearing towards the beginning of next
week. I am working on talking points and a press release. We need to keep our messaging very
controlled. Also, I would welcome input on plans for public testimony at the hearing. I am working
on some drafts which I will post ASAP.

I was able to visit with Matt Sharpe at ADF about my previous questions
and have incorporated what I believe is a much improved strategy in
section (5). I am sending this final draft [vital statistics draft(3)
attached below] to you, to ADF , and to our folks here a vital
statistics. Hopefully we are near or at our final draft so that we can
work on securing support from the governor's office. Leadership appears
to be supportive so I have good reason to hope we will soon have a
hearing. Thank you again for your help!

In regard to the last question: a colleague who is an attorney
suggested that a better approach may be to stipulate that the
physician make a presumptive determination of male or female and
that after undergoing the appropriate combination of genetic
analysis and evaluation of the individual's naturally
occurring internal and external reproductive anatomy a signed
affidavit from the parents and the physician may be submitted
within 3 years or the presumptive determination may be challenged
in a court as stipulated in (4). This eliminates the potential
for an open-ended indeterminate status.
Thoughts on this idea?

My apologies if this is redundant. I have tried to 'reply

not sure that it worked. If you could ensure that the

it. Thanks so much.
Our vital statistics folks in the Department of Health and
Welfare have raised some questions which we have attempted
to address in the attached draft. Their comments focused
primarily on 39-245A (4) and (5).
They wanted to ensure that the language stipulated that
the affidavit be one provided by the department and asked
that we make some changes in formatting to make the
process more clear to the public. I believe the changes

to (4) are straightforward.
They raised some good questions regarding (5) though:
1- Our current language does not require verification from
a medical professional that the appropriate chromosomal
analysis and evaluation of anatomy has taken place and
that the decision of sex is appropriate based on that
analysis and evaluation.
2- Our language is silent about what happens if they don't
resolve the indeterminate status within the three years.
Do we need to specify that it can be resoled in court
after this? Do we need to specify any requirements should
that be the case?
The drafter and I took a stab at it in the attached
draft. Again, feedback is appreciated. Thank you to
those who are providing review on this!
