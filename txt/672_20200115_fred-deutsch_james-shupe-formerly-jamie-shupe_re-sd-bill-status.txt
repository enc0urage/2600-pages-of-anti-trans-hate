The trans shills at the AP only managed to use the word "gender" 11 times in that piece.
"children who do not identify with their biological gender."
For the uninitiated, AP even has a stylebook about how to speak the language of trans.

Great stuff, Rep. Deutsch!
You're wearing the Armor of God in this fight.
