Subject: Re: Idaho Vital Statistics Integrity Act - short window for comments - by Friday, January 24

H509 passed the Senate 27-6 with the support of every Republican Senator. The governor is receiving national pressure to veto. Any
support that can be communicated is helpful: governor@gov.idaho.gov

Here is a link to my Facebook page where I posted my comments, as I provided them to CNN, along with a link to their 'news coverage' of
H509. https://www.facebook.com/YoungForIdahoHouse/

Thank you again for your help and support in this effort. Prayers for the governor and his staff now!

Yesterday H500, a bill protecting female athletes from being displaced by biological males, was debated in the Senate and
passed 11 to 24. I believe the vote will be similar on H509. It is now about bill number 30 on the Senate third reading
calendar. I continue to pray that we get a vote before we are disbanded due to the coronavirus. If we adjourn, it will die. It
could be late today if bills move quickly or, perhaps, tomorrow.

Our committee hearing went well and we came through Senate State Affairs with a party line vote. 509 has
been hanging on the Senate third reading calendar waiting for a floor vote for several days and they are not
moving business through very quickly. There are more than 50 bills ahead of us and they are talking about
adjourning mid-week next week because of the corona virus. We have the support of leadership but the
Democrats will be attempting to use the time pressure against us. Your prayers are appreciated.

Consider if you are a mother of a

decide without your involvement to change
her birth certificate. This legal document
would now say that you gave birth to a

That is one of the
arguments we are making
regarding the school
affirmation policies, i.e., the
state is compelling students
to utter a false statement,
which violates free speech
and free exercise rights (or
rights of conscience
generally). That's underlying
pronoun policies and privacy
facilities use policies
requiring children to affirm
classmates are girls when

they are boys.

Have you considered the
argument from the parent
perspective? When birth
certificates are changed,
they create a legal fiction
involving unwilling parents:
That a mother who gave
birth to a daughter gave birth
to a son, and vice versa. As
recently as last month, a
mother wrote to us
expressing absolute shock
that her young adult
daughter can change her
birth certificate without her
permission. As she stated,
she and her husband do not
want their names connected
to a "blatant lie."

on a biological definition of
sex. Yet, this court relied
upon the conflation of sex
and gender identity in
issuing their ruling. The
conflation of these terms in
the law severely undermines
the compelling interest of
the state and jeopardizes
the health and safety of all
Idahoans. Sex specific
policies have been upheld
by the courts for decades
specifically because of the
material distinctions
between male and female,
statistically speaking. If we
accept the premise that
these distinctions are
irrelevant, that sex is gender
identity irrespective of
biological fact, we must also
find that all sex-based
distinctions are
discriminatory.
