Subject: Re: Idaho Vital Statistics Integrity Act - short window for

As I look a little closer, the testimony from Jamie O'Neill appears to address 3 bills moving through the house
right now: the vital statistics act, a 'fairness in sports' act, and a bill that adds language to existing statute
prohibiting female genital mutilation to prevent cross sex treatments for minors. This diminishes some of the
credibility since the author doesn't appear to understand what is being put forward.
However, if can provide some
good professional counters (especially to the IOC consensus meeting) this would be good. F.V. v Barron relied, in
part, on the claim that modern medical authorities understand sex and gender identity to be the same and that a
biology based definition of sex is "archaic".

Thank you so much for the feedback. One thing that keeps nagging at my mind along these lines is that the
court relied on a gender identity definition of sex in order to find that the state violated the equal
protection clause-- "We didn't treat the plaintiffs (biological males) like other women," etc. This ruling
was not about whether the plaintiffs could change their sex identifier, it was about whether it was lawful
for a state to identify citizens based on biology. In practice, the F.V. v Barron ruling ignored the
existing state defined biology based definition and imposed a new definition of sex on the state without
ever directly addressing an argument as to why this was justified. It was assumed via their circular
arguments. If there are court cases or other info which could help me attack the ruling from this angle it
could be helpful. Shouldn't a court be mandated to rule based on existing definitions in the law? As long
as people hold the ruling to be legitimate our fight will be much harder.

Almost right, Gary ... in Transtopia you are a man if and only if the State authenticates what you say
you are (and take that one step further ... a man is NOT a father because he is a man who sired a child;
he is only a father if the State says he is ... although this is also a consequence first of Obergefell).

A point that keeps niggling at me is there is sort of a universal coercion from GEID theory. If I am
forced to affirm a person as transgender, perforce I must identify myself not as a male, but as a cisgender man. I'm not male because I was created male in the womb, but because I now think I am a man. And
it's not just semantics--adopting gender language means I have to abandon objective science and accept
the subjective malleable continuum of unprovable "genders" in place of real science.
You can't take one step into the alternate universe of trans without abandoning your own universe.

Haven't had a chance to watch the hearing, but was this argument part of the testimony?

Thank you, Julianne. Have you considered the argument from the parent perspective? When birth
certificates are changed, they create a legal fiction involving unwilling parents: That a mother who
gave birth to a daughter gave birth to a son, and vice versa. As recently as last month, a mother
wrote to us expressing absolute shock that her young adult daughter can change her birth certificate
without her permission. As she stated, she and her husband do not want their names connected to a
"blatant lie."

The House State Affairs committee sent our bill to the floor on a party line vote with a do-pass
recommendation.
We had some great testimony (in opposition) from the National Organization of Women representative,
Janelle Winterstein. Janelle opposed the bill, suggesting that it is uncharacteristic of the
acceptance and kindness she has felt from Idahoans, including many of the more conservative members
of the state affairs committee. It seems that this testimony would be a great benefit should a
court be seeking evidence that this bill is motivated by animus.
Our strongest opposition came from the Lambda Legal Attorney who represented the plaintiffs in F.V.
v Barron (a very tall woman if you're skimming the video looking for her testimony). She countered
some of my statements which suggested that this issue has not been robustly examined based on it's
impacts on public policy and the state generally because the state conceded everything and the
arguments make (based on the West Law minutes) addressed only the interests of the agency and not
the public at large. She argued that everything I brought up had already been heard and considered
by the court and that they have already decided this issue. By passing this bill, we are placing
the DHW in a position to be found in contempt of court. This argument, coupled with the court
costs may sway moderate republicans in the House and could stop the bill in the Senate if we don't
have a strong counter-argument on the House floor. It could be up for debate on the floor as soon
as next Tuesday and must be transmitted to the Senate by the end of the week.
The video of the hearing is available
here: https://legislature.idaho.gov/sessioninfo/2020/standingcommittees/HSTA/ . It does take
awhile to open. It was about a 2 hour hearing. There was a very short bill right before mine but
it only took a couple of minutes. Most of the file is our bill.
Counter arguments I am considering include:
The proposed statute complies with the requirement of the injunction in that the statute does not

automatically reject applications to amend this category of material facts, but establishes a
process by which those applications may be reviewed and considered. This process protects the
interest of the state in ensuring the accuracy of material statistics.
The legislature rejects the argument that biological sex is gender identity.
Courts are required
to observe the definitions established in the law. The legislative branch, including on the
federal level, has consistently acted on a biological definition of sex. Yet, this court relied
upon the conflation of sex and gender identity in issuing their ruling. The conflation of these
terms in the law severely undermines the compelling interest of the state and jeopardizes the
health and safety of all Idahoans.
Sex specific policies have been upheld by the courts for
decades specifically because of the material distinctions between male and female, statistically
speaking. If we accept the premise that these distinctions are irrelevant, that sex is gender
identity irrespective of biological fact, we must also find that all sex-based distinctions are
discriminatory.
I would sincerely appreciate legal feedback and suggestions.

In regard to the last question: a colleague who is an attorney suggested that a better
approach may be to stipulate that the physician make a presumptive determination of male
or female and that after undergoing the appropriate combination of genetic analysis and
evaluation of the individual's naturally occurring internal and external
reproductive anatomy a signed affidavit from the parents and the physician may be
submitted within 3 years or the presumptive determination may be challenged in a court as
stipulated in (4). This eliminates the potential for an open-ended indeterminate

Thoughts on this idea?

My apologies if this is redundant. I have tried to 'reply all' in order to share this

Our vital statistics folks in the Department of Health and Welfare have raised some
questions which we have attempted to address in the attached draft. Their comments
focused primarily on 39-245A (4) and (5).
They wanted to ensure that the language stipulated that the affidavit be one provided by
the department and asked that we make some changes in formatting to make the process
more clear to the public. I believe the changes to (4) are straightforward.
They raised some good questions regarding (5) though:
1- Our current language does not require verification from a medical professional that
the appropriate chromosomal analysis and evaluation of anatomy has taken place and that
the decision of sex is appropriate based on that analysis and evaluation.
2- Our language is silent about what happens if they don't resolve the indeterminate
status within the three years. Do we need to specify that it can be resoled in court
after this? Do we need to specify any requirements should that be the case?
The drafter and I took a stab at it in the attached draft. Again, feedback is
appreciated. Thank you to those who are providing review on this!
