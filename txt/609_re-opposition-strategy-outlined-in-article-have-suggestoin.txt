Subject: Re: Opposition strategy outlined in article. Have suggestoin

In case it's not on the radar, the same folks arguing for chemical castration in children for the purpose of gender
confirmation are usually against the same thing being used on sex offenders. The treatments are one and the same.

Exactly.
And even in the case of something like cancer, any sterilization is a side effect, rather than a goal, of a
treatment for other purposes. There's no directive that children with cancer must be sterilized, and if doctors
could prevent that outcome, surely they would. For no other type of child is that considered a humane end goal of
treatment.

Kara will be joining us to testify, and I bet that she would be willing to join a statement saying that
there's no definable class of person who needs to be sterilized as children.

Fred and all,
CPR-C can prepare a rebuttal this week to the ACLU that Mary (UCAL Berkely), Jane Robbins (Harvard Law),
and I (Harvard Law, Guardian ad Litem for children) can sign and send. I can ask Kara Dansky (former
ACLU lawyer) of Womens Liberation Front if she’d be willing to sign from the left. Mary’s email re:
involuntary sterilization would be key part of the response. We also need to stress the point the the
ACLU is entirely missing the point of this bill — it nothing to do with discriminating against any class
of children, but rather everything to do with protecting a vulnerable group of children, and all children
(given the social contagion). While there may be a constitutional right to refuse to carry a child to
term (under Roe), there is no constitutional right to chemically and surgically mutiliating one’s healthy
body, where there is no disease to be treated — that is child abuse.
When would you need this?

On a different note, I have this new thread dispelling the "wrong puberty" argument.

Yes, and also point out that these procedures amount to involuntary sterilization of minors. They cannot legally or psychologically consent. Their parents
cannot give informed consent since the knowledge necessary for informed consent does not exist. The Supreme Court struck down laws providing for
sterilization of serial criminals in Skinner v. Oklahoma and mentally incompetent adults cannot be sterilized even if their guardians consent without a court
order. Are the ACLU and similar groups advocating for involuntary sterilization of children? Also their equal protection arguments are without merit. "
Transchildren" are not being treated differently from other children. In fact the opposite is true. This bill will ensure that "transchildren" have the same
protections from dangerous medical experiments as do other children.

No doctor or parent has a right to subject a child to a life-altering medical experiment with unknown long-term consequences. Without this ban in place, SD
will follow what is already happening in other states: minors who successfully sue in court to obtain this supposedly "life-saving" medical intervention. And
when they grow up with irreversible regret, who will be liable? The state.
This ban is also important to prevent custody battles. We have several parents who have reached out to the KC because of a former spouse who is intent
on medicalizing their child. Finding an attorney to help is nearly as difficult as finding a therapist. And even when they do, who knows how a judge will rule?
Banning these procedures will take these serious medical decisions away from misinformed judges.
The claim that this is lifesaving medically necessary intervention is the big unchallenged domino that is driving both the legal and medical scandal. This is an
oft-repeated claim with no support and it must be confronted directly.

Mike,
Look at the medical claim in that "legal" ACLU quote; it is false on multiple grounds
"no such thing as a medically diagnosable group of trans anybody; we are talking about minors! blockers, wrong sex hormones and surgical mutilation are
never medically necessary in minors!"
