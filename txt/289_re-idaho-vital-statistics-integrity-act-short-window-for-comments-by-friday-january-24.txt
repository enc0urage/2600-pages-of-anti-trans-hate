Re: Idaho Vital Statistics Integrity Act - short window for comments - by Friday, January 24
Attachments: Vital Statistics final draft (2).pdf

The Department of Health and Welfare brought some suggestions yesterday.
'material fact' rather than 'vital statistic' in several places.

The suggested the use of the term

Also, they raised some good questions regarding sections 39-245A (4) and (5).
their comments in the attached draft as follows:

The drafter and I tried to address

• additional language clarifying that the affidavit will be on a form prescribed by the registrar
• simplifies the format so that requirements are clear
• In section (5) they raised a legitimate point that, unlike (4) no medical authority was required to verify the
action

• The language was silent about what happens if they fail to come back withing the 3 years. We added some language
indicating that this could be addressed by the court but it's not very tight.
touches are appreciated.

Suggestions on these finishing

Representative Young

All,

Please meet Steve Smith, an Idaho allied attorney, and Idaho Representative Julianne Young. They have been working on a birth certificate protection bill, to reverse a recent court decision striking down
sex-based birth certificates in Idaho. This will restore the status quo, making Idaho one of four states that require birth certificates to reflect sex, along with Kansas, Ohio, and Tennessee.

Julianne has a short window to receive comments (especially desired from the medical experts).

Matt Sharp provided ADF factual findings for the recitals and some edits. I have accepted his changes; made a few suggested edits of my own, and thus open it up to you all for any input for Julianne and
Steve.

There may be an opportunity for expert testimony, but I leave the details on that to Rep. Young.

Thanks,
