I like it â€” much better than â€œincorrectâ€​. Now to make it air-tight, I would add: â€œas defined by Section 1
of Chapter 26-10â€​ after â€œchildâ€™s sexâ€​ to ensure no other definition could be understood. In the bill the
definition of sex appears right above, but I donâ€™t know how far away it would actually appear in the SD code.
Fred, is it common for SD code provisions to explicitly reference a code definition?

It is in the GA Code.

What do you think of the following language in red as a solution? Remember, the bill defines Sex as the "the biological state of being female or male, based on sex organs, chromosomes, and endogenous

19 chromosomes, and endogenous hormone profiles.
