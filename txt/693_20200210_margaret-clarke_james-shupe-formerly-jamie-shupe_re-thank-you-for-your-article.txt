Thank you as well, Margaret, for your kind words and support.
I prayed for Fred and the rest of you yesterday that have been willing to take on this big fight.
Fred's facing another hearing today, and I'm proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with all of you on this important issue. You're not wrong about this, it really is what needs to
happen to protect these children and their parents.
Blessings,
James

Good morning James,
Thank you for your precious message of redemption. I am leading a coalition her in Alabama to adopt a bill similar to Rep. Fred Deutschâ€™s. He and Michelle have been coaching us. You will be on our prayer
list. It is so encouraging to see the genuine work of the Lord in your heart and your courage to admit failure. More importantly that Jesus Christ is the sole help of you heart and sole. Heart change is the
greatest miracle of all!! Your testimony gives God great glory!!!
Thank you so much,
Margaret
