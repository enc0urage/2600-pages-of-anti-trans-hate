Subject: Re: "How Oregon Built A Transgender Medical-Industrial Complex On Junk Science"

Dear Team
After reading about the Oregon Hospital and their gender program, I can not describe the horror that I personally
feel. My mental illness and gender dysphoria came out of a broken home with a drunk for a father, and a mother who
was mentally ill who sexually abused me. The mental torment that I felt growing up was horrific. GD has played a key
part in all of my relationships and life decisions.
To this very day I suffer from the consequences that GD has had on my life. But the doctors I dealt with were all,
uniformly reluctant to allow any individual to pass through the ultimate gate towards SRS. They all understood it
was a last resort for the desperate.
And to think that any medical institution would further and promote the debacle that GD has on young people is
nothing less than vile and despicable in the extreme .
I understand that multiple factors has caused ROGD epidemic. But for anyone in the medical community to do what
Oregon medical community has done is criminal.
How can we stop this? We must stop this. How?

Sincerely

Rene Jax
