Friends,
On April 4th, I will give a 45 min power point presentation to the Committee of 10 Bishops from the United States
Council of Catholic Bishops that is responsible for drafting transgender guidelines for America's Catholic
Hospitals, physicians and health systems.
I am entitling it "A Cry for Help NOT Hormones" and will cover the science as it pertains to kids & adults;
underlying (anti-Christian) worldview and societal ramifications.
Would the four of you allow me to use a head shot of each of you on my title slide? I want the Bishops to know I am
talking about REAL people.
Michelle
