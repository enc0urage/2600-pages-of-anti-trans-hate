Subject: Detransitioner Amici brief for SCOTUS
All,
With some gracious assistance, Walt Heyer, myself and some of the other detransitioners were also able to submit an amicus.
https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/18/18-107/113528/20190824011904782_18-107%20Amicus%20Brief%20of%20Walt%20Heyer%20et%20al..pdf
Praying for our joint success in these endeavors for change.
James

Hola, Team SD.
I worked with Michelle Cretella and a law professor at request of Alliance Defending Freedom to get out this amici for the SCOTUS Harris Funeral Home case. We directly took on the AMA and friends amici, which was not
that hard to disprove, IMHO. It’s the best I think we’ve ever done, though admittedly the others were Circuit Court cases and not SCOTUS. The law professor requests that his name be kept out of communications involving
this, as he is job hunting right now. I and Michelle are the primary researchers and therefor authors anyway, and conveniently our names do not appear on it (such is how group projects often go and so be it). Don’t fear the
page count, citations run up through page 18.
Also, my CMDA blog from yesterday seems to be on fire already, reprint approval requested by Christian Post, several bloggers already posted, other cool stuff, etc.
