Margaret and Michelle,
Sharing with the two of you for insight this court order from the big Wisconson transgender case that forces Medicaid to pay for surgeries.
"Everyone has a gender identity, and for most people, their gender identity is consistent with the sex designated on their birth certificate (variously referred to in medical
literature as one’s “assigned,” “designated” or “natal” sex)."

The LGBT lawyers wrote this into the case and the judge parroted it in his order. That's how serious this is.

Margaret,
I hope that your AL Eagle Forum can educate legislators and I will mention the importance of language at the St. Louis Meeting. This is unfortunate re: AL "GIRL ACT" (see below by James Shupe - the former
first legally recognized "non-binary" American who came to embrace reality and Christ, and just won the legal right to change his legal sex designation back to male). I am not sure we can correct the GIRL
ACT (I've not been able to give that thought yet).
In a nutshell: Sex is real, physical ... gender is SUBJECTIVE heavily rooted in sex stereotypes - we can have feminine appearing men; masculine appearing women but sex trumps gender in sports (and reality
generally). Gender is a poisonous word.
Best,
Michelle

Subject: Sex Not Gender

All,
Speaking of legislative issues. Please do your best to educate lawmakers and others in the harm of using the word gender instead of sex.
This is Exhibit A from yesterday's news: “Gender is Real Legislative (GIRL) Act”
https://www.al.com/news/2020/01/alabama-lawmaker-aims-to-keep-transgender-athletes-off-school-teams.html
I shared this with Roger Brooks earlier.
The legal definition of gender only listed “masculine, feminine or neuter” to establish that state law applied equally to men and women, even when masculine pronouns were used, the Tuesday
opinion said.
The appellate panel instead based its reasoning on the dictionary meaning of the word “gender” in 1988, which limited the meaning to “sex,” or the “biological roles of male and female.”
To assume that the 1988 use of “gender” in the ethnic intimidation law encompassed transgender individuals “strains credulity” and so the law cannot be applied to Steuball’s case, Gadola
wrote.

Similarly, as training materials are produced, it would be great to create some stuff about the dirty and inconsistent history of gender identity to educate lawmakers and give
them talking points, something I've come to believe many policymaker are not familiar with.
I've started plugging all the inconsistent definitions of gender identity into this site of mine.
We've gone from the John Money days of transsexuals having a gender identity to it now being claimed that well have a gender identity. Then around 2011, the other 80 or so
flavors of gender started getting unleashed and backed by the APA, etc.

The language matters. Every time we use the words gender or gender identity we are advancing the ideology as real and legit Apologies if I come off as preaching on this one,
but I'm proof of the harm.
Blessings,
James
