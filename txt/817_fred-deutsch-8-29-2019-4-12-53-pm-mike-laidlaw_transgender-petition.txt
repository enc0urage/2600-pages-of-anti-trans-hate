Transgender petition
Attachments: Gender Change Petition etc - Judge Powers case.pdf
One of our stateâ€™s local newspapers ran a legal notice today to change the name and â€œgender-markerâ€​ of a minor. Since there is no statutory authority to change a gender-marker (the term is foreign to
the legislature and to me â€“ I had to Google it), a trip to the courthouse found the petition. See attached.
Of note:

• The petition asked that no public notice be given.
• The judge has already ordered a name change; he believed notice of hearing was necessary before considering the proposed "gender marker" change.
• Petitioners are pro se. But according to FB, Petitioner is an attorney. Petitioners are a divorced lesbian couple. One is biologic mom, other is adoptive parent. Biologic dad had rights terminated in
earlier adoption proceeding.
• The petition relies upon SDCL 21-37-5 which governs name changes. There is no separate authority cited for the gender change.
• This is a 13 year old child (will be 14 in two months). The childâ€™s Sioux Falls doctor plans to begin him on â€œgender confirming hormones.â€​

One of the challenges in bringing a bill like we are attempting is to show legislators these problems occur in our state. Introducing this document into the hearing will help show legislators weâ€™re not just
blowing smoke. Good strategic find, I think. â€“ Fred
