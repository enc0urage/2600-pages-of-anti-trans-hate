All,
Iâ€™ve got a new piece out in the Public Discourse tonight on why the Pediatric Endocrine Society is wrong
about puberty blockers being reversible and is ignoring serious harms.

https://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2020/01/59422/

Please read and share widely with legislators, educators, friends family etc.

I think it will help in the intellectual battle when trying to get our important legislation passed in the
states.

Thanks

Terrific information, particularly on background to support the position. Thank you for the obviously significant time and thought applied. I'm likely late to this "team", but thanks
to Fred and Michelle, am grateful for all the expertise. There is a small but growing number of us in the Catholic Medical Association who are pushing this issue forward, and this
type of information is great help in getting ahead of it.
