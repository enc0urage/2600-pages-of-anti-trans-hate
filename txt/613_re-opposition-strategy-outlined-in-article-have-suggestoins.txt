Look at the medical claim in that "legal" ACLU quote; it is false on multiple grounds
"no such thing as a medically diagnosable group of trans anybody; we are talking about minors! blockers, wrong sex

"The ACLU of SD said in a statement that it's unconstitutional to single out one group of people and categorically ban all care, no matter how medically necessary".
Legal experts have an opinion on that statement?
