Subject: Opposition Strategy Suggestions
All,
In an earlier email, I talked about how treatment being unavailable because of law would serve as a deterrent, using the example of how kids aren't pestering their parents to drink because
they know the law says they can't until age 21. This excerpt reinforces this.
Page 58: "It is not rare for preoperative transsexuals to abandon their quest for reassignment; it is not well-established that such cases are more likely to involve secondary transsexuals,
but this is what we would predict. Shore (1984) reports the case of a young man who was positive he wanted sexual reassignment, was favorably evaluated for surgery, and was on his way
to the hospital when he learned the hospital had changed their policy and now prohibited sex reassignment surgery. This man, soon thereafter, changed his entire life-style and reportedly
gave up his sex-reassignment plans."
Speaking from experience, this is very impulsive stuff in many cases, and the lowering of barriers in today's environment is creating a far more dangerous landscape. Remember, I got
hormones during my first visit to a mental health provider.

So, for one we are shifting the fight from inside the home with the parents to the state, and two, we are putting up a roadblock to the impulsiveness that's inherently characteristic with a lot of
the co-morbid mental health issues these children have.
