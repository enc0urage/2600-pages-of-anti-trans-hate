Subject: Re: Idaho Vital Statistics Integrity Act - short window for

Here are my thoughts on how you should go about attacking gender identity. The foundation of the thing is built upon
a sexual paraphilia, a transvestic disorder, that's been gradually cleansed.
So I attacked two avenues in my sex change petition, legal fiction, and the sexual paraphilia.
"Autogynephilia is defined as a male's propensity to be sexually aroused by the thought of himself as a female. It
is the paraphilia that is theorized to underlie transvestism and some forms of male-to-female (MtF) transsexualism."
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22005209
The transvestic disorder develops into a female persona:
"The fifth step in becoming a transvestite involves fixing the gratification pattern in the identity of the
transvestite. Until this fifth step occurs one cannot speak of a person as being a true transvestite; he may have
branched off into some other form of deviant sexual behavior, or he may be functioning in a normal heterosexual
pattern. The combination of the initial autoerotic retreat with the elaboration of the fetishistic interest into
complete cross-dressing, and possibly the development of a feminine personality within the individual(8) as an alter
ego to his male personality (78% feel themselves a different personality when dressed in women's
clothes(9)), provides a synthetic dyad within the individual which gives him the libidinal rewards of both
narcissistic and dyadic regression (Slater, esp. p. 348)."
http://www.tbuckner.com/TRANSVES.HTM
It then develops into gender dysphoria:
"Later in life (sometimes in their 50s or 60s), some men who were cross-dressers only in their teens and twenties
develop gender dysphoria."

https://www.merckmanuals.com/home/mental-health-disorders/sexuality-and-sexual-disorders/transvestism
They'll counter, that this doesn't explain male children but actually it does:
"Case reports by Stoller (1985) and by Zucker and Blanchard (1997) make it clear that genital arousal with crossdressing can occur as early as age 3 years."
http://www.annelawrence.com/autogynephilia,_a_paraphilic_model_of_GID.pdf
Last, look at all the inconsistent definitions of gender identity I've gathered. The trans organizations aren't even
consistent.
https://sites.google.com/view/genderidentitydefinitions/gender-identity-definitions?authuser=0
How females arrive at having gender dysphoria is much different and I'll leave it to Kara, Natasha, and Kelsey to
give you a narrative for that. The females came into this much later, but they're now the vehicle for the school
cases because nothing says male like facial hair that's been created by testosterone injections.

Thank you so much for the feedback. One thing that keeps nagging at my mind along these lines is that the court
relied on a gender identity definition of sex in order to find that the state violated the equal protection clause-"We didn't treat the plaintiffs (biological males) like other women," etc. This ruling was not about whether the
plaintiffs could change their sex identifier, it was about whether it was lawful for a state to identify citizens
based on biology. In practice, the F.V. v Barron ruling ignored the existing state defined biology based definition
and imposed a new definition of sex on the state without ever directly addressing an argument as to why this was
justified. It was assumed via their circular arguments. If there are court cases or other info which could help me
attack the ruling from this angle it could be helpful. Shouldn't a court be mandated to rule based on existing
definitions in the law? As long as people hold the ruling to be legitimate our fight will be much harder.

Courts are required to

observe the definitions established in the law. The legislative branch, including on the federal level, has
consistently acted on a biological definition of sex. Yet, this court relied upon the conflation of sex and gender
identity in issuing their ruling. The conflation of these terms in the law severely undermines the compelling
interest of the state and jeopardizes the health and safety of all Idahoans.
Sex specific policies have been
upheld by the courts for decades specifically because of the material distinctions between male and female,
statistically speaking. If we accept the premise that these distinctions are irrelevant, that sex is gender
identity irrespective of biological fact, we must also find that all sex-based distinctions are discriminatory.

First, the reference"cisgender-identifying individuals." I believe there is way to make this point, without using a
word like "cis" which indirectly endorses the ideology upon which transgender identities are based.

both categories for people to check when they identify themselves.

counter the arguments raised in the law-suit is the insert some additional language into our legislative intent,
rather than addressing another section of code. My additions are highlighted below. Your feedback is sincerely
appreciated.

biology-based statistics on Idaho certificates of birth which provide vital statistics fundamental to the
performance of government functions that secure the public health and safety, including, but not limited to,
identifying public health trends, assessing risks, conducting criminal investigations, and helping individuals
determine their biological lineage, citizenship, or susceptibility to genetic disorders; and,

of general applicability such as a biology-based definition of sex which has been consistently applied since our
nation's founding.

between male and female justify separate but equal treatment under the law and a defined category of sex which
relies on biological fact is the only category which can be demonstrated to have obvious, immutable, and
distinguishable characteristics.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> The definitional erasure of biological sex significantly impacts the rights of others
and would constitute manifest injustice in undermining the implementation of many policies which have been advanced
to secure the privacy and interests of individuals specific to their biological sex.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> The erasure of biological sex negatively impacts the health and safety of all
individuals. For example, the Society for Evidence-Based Gender Medicine has declared that “the conflation of sex
and gender in healthcare is alarming and is poised to subject hundreds of thousands of transgender and cisgenderidentifying individuals to unintended medical harm from receiving incorrect diagnoses and being subjected to
incorrect treatments. It will also greatly impede scientific research, not only in the area of transgender

treatments, which sorely lacks quality long-term outcome evidence, but also in other areas of medical research.”
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
“Vital statistics” is defined in Idaho Code Section 39-241(21) as “data,” (being the
plural of “datum”) which is a known fact; and,

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Idaho certificates of birth are of an evidentiary character and prima facie evidence
of the facts recited therein (Code Section 39-274); and,
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

are legally applicable facts fundamental to the performance of public and private policies and contracts.

upon which government and others may with confidence rely constitutes a breach of the public trust; and

and a duty to fulfill, to the best of its ability, those functions which rely on accurate vital statistics; and,

specific quantitative, material facts at the time of birth: time of birth, date of birth, place of birth and
biological sex.

down sex-based birth certificates in Idaho. This will restore the status quo, making Idaho one of four states that
require birth certificates to reflect sex, along with Kansas, Ohio, and Tennessee.
