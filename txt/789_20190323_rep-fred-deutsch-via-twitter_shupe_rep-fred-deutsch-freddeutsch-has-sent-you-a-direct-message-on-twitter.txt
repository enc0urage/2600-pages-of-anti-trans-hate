@FredDeutsch: Drivers license is not currently an issue. Allowing transgender students to participate on the opposite biological sex’s team has been to our legislature three times and lost each time. Student privacy had been to the legislature once in 2016. It passed but was vetoed by the governor. We are also discussing making it illegal for a physician to practice affirmation therapy on minors. The challenge in getting these bills passes is too many buy into transgender ideology. Too few recognize it as a lie.
