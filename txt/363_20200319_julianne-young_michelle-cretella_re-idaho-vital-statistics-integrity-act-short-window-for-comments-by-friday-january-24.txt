Subject: Re: Idaho Vital Statistics Integrity Act - short window for comments - by Friday, January 24
H509 passed the Senate 27-6 with the support of every Republican Senator. The governor is receiving national
pressure to veto. Any support that can be communicated is helpful: governor@gov.idaho.gov
Here is a link to my Facebook page where I posted my comments, as I provided them to CNN, along with a link to their
'news coverage' of H509.

Thank you again for your help and support in this effort.

Prayers for the governor and his staff now!

Yesterday H500, a bill protecting female athletes from being displaced by biological males, was debated in the
Senate and passed 11 to 24. I believe the vote will be similar on H509. It is now about bill number 30 on the
Senate third reading calendar. I continue to pray that we get a vote before we are disbanded due to the
coronavirus. If we adjourn, it will die. It could be late today if bills move quickly or, perhaps, tomorrow.

Our committee hearing went well and we came through Senate State Affairs with a party line vote. 509 has been
hanging on the Senate third reading calendar waiting for a floor vote for several days and they are not moving
business through very quickly. There are more than 50 bills ahead of us and they are talking about adjourning midweek next week because of the corona virus. We have the support of leadership but the Democrats will be attempting

to use the time pressure against us.

Your prayers are appreciated.

we will present and who might be able to testify. I will let you know as soon as I have more information.

Although we all know this whole thing is ridiculous and it is Orwellian that we have to have a bill to say that
1+1=2, I think sometimes people can see this issue more clearly when we can personalize the issue.
Consider if you are a mother of a daughter. One day your daughter could decide without your involvement to change
her birth certificate. This legal document would now say that you gave birth to a son. You have zero say. This
document is a lie about your personal life and your health history and is happening to KC parents in many states.

As these bills are advanced, I think it's important to do at least some education on the history of gender identity,
even if just briefly, because I don't believe there are very many lawmakers that are actually knowledgeable on the
topic. No doubt many of them will find it disturbing to learn they're older than the quack theories behind the whole
sham.

placing the DHW in a position to be found in contempt of court. This argument, coupled with the court costs may
sway moderate republicans in the House and could stop the bill in the Senate if we don't have a strong counterargument on the House floor. It could be up for debate on the floor as soon as next Tuesday and must be transmitted

>>>> The legislature rejects the argument that biological sex is gender identity.
Courts are required to observe
the definitions established in the law. The legislative branch, including on the federal level, has consistently
acted on a biological definition of sex. Yet, this court relied upon the conflation of sex and gender identity in
issuing their ruling. The conflation of these terms in the law severely undermines the compelling interest of the
state and jeopardizes the health and safety of all Idahoans.
Sex specific policies have been upheld by the courts
for decades specifically because of the material distinctions between male and female, statistically speaking. If
we accept the premise that these distinctions are irrelevant, that sex is gender identity irrespective of biological
fact, we must also find that all sex-based distinctions are discriminatory.

First, the reference"cisgender-identifying individuals." I believe there is way to make this point, without using a
word like "cis" which indirectly endorses the ideology upon which transgender identities are based.

For example, the Society for Evidence-Based Gender Medicine has declared that “the conflation of sex and gender in
healthcare is alarming and is poised to subject hundreds of thousands of transgender and cisgender-identifying
individuals to unintended medical harm from receiving incorrect diagnoses and being subjected to incorrect
treatments. It will also greatly impede scientific research, not only in the area of transgender treatments, which
sorely lacks quality long-term outcome evidence, but also in other areas of medical research.”
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

“Vital statistics” is defined in Idaho Code Section 39-241(21) as “data,” (being the
plural of “datum”) which is a known fact; and,

Idaho certificates of birth are of an evidentiary character and prima facie evidence of
the facts recited therein (Code Section 39-274); and,
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

legally applicable facts fundamental to the performance of public and private policies and contracts.

which government and others may with confidence rely constitutes a breach of the public trust; and

quantitative, material facts at the time of birth: time of birth, date of birth, place of birth and biological sex.
