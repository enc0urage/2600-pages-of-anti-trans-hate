All,
I have wonderful news to share. With the help of ADF, I have successfully petitioned the State of Oregon to restore my male birth sex and given name.
Working with the Oregon attorney that ADF secured, I crafted language in the petition I hope will be useful in future legal battles and prevent further use of the non-binary court order to
advance that agenda.
The story should be out soon on PJMedia.
Attached are the court documents.
Blessings,
James Shupe
