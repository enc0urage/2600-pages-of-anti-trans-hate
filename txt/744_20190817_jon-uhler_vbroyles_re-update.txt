All, just a note to update you on status of the Vulnerable Child Protection Act.

Iâ€™m comfortable the bill and white paper are at or near final form.

Iâ€™ve begun my road trips across the state to meet with key moderate Republicans. Response has been mixed but mostly positive. Not a single legislator
Iâ€™ve spoken with so far has a clue about whatâ€™s happening with transgender advocacy nor affirmative therapy. All of this is new to them.

Despite the generally positive response, I have no doubt this will be an uphill battle when we get to session. The last time I introduced a transgender-related bill in
2016, the state and the governor experienced political and economic pressures including boycott threats from around the country. I doubt this time will be any
different.

I meet with the governorâ€™s top policy advisor next week to discuss the bill.

Iâ€™ve targeted about 20% of the legislature to meet one-on-one prior to session.

KC from Kelsey Coalition will be developing her suggested strategy for testimony that Iâ€™ll bounce off our South Dakota team.

As always, please do not share this with media. The longer we can fly under the radar, the better.

Please let me know if you have questions. I am grateful for your support and prayers.

Jamieâ€™s new version does seem explicit to me despite my previous objection to adding biological.
I also think â€œincorrect perceptionâ€​ as KC suggested works well.

I'm still in favor of Andre's version, with just a change to biological instead of natal, because it tackles both meanings very explicitly.
Proposed: "attempting to change the childâ€™s acceptance of their biological sex or to affirm the childâ€™s perception if other than their biological sex.â€​
Andre's original: "attempting to change the childâ€™s acceptance of their natal sex or to affirm the childâ€™s perception if other than their natal sex.â€​
I had my wife, who largely stays out of the trans issues, read the paragraph last night and she was confused by the language in the sentence we've been debating, so there's
definitely a problem with it.

All, what do you think about KCâ€™s suggest to add incorrect to the sentence: â€œ...attempting to change or affirm the childâ€™s incorrect perception of their sex.â€​

I like the idea â€“ I think it helps to further narrow the bill and avoids causing problems with other medical conditions. But does adding the word cause addâ€™l problems? The other side will certainly argue
â€œwho are you to say whatâ€™s an incorrect perception?â€​ The answer, of course, is if perception varies from reality, than it is an incorrect perception (the billâ€™s definition of sex is reality). That said, the
process is political. Does the change cast doubt in the mind of legislators about who is to say whatâ€™s an incorrect perception? - Fred
