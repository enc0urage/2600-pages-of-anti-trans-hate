Thanks, Vernadette!
We're getting some traction too.
So far The Washington Examiner and The Federalist have reported on our brief.
God bless,
James

All,
With some gracious assistance, Walt Heyer, myself and some of the other detransitioners were also able to submit an amicus.

Hola, Team SD.
I worked with Michelle Cretella and a law professor at request of Alliance Defending Freedom to get out this amici for the SCOTUS Harris Funeral Home case. We directly took on the AMA and friends amici,
which was not that hard to disprove, IMHO. It’s the best I think we’ve ever done, though admittedly the others were Circuit Court cases and not SCOTUS. The law professor requests that his name be kept out
of communications involving this, as he is job hunting right now. I and Michelle are the primary researchers and therefor authors anyway, and conveniently our names do not appear on it (such is how group
projects often go and so be it). Don’t fear the page count, citations run up through page 18.
Also, my CMDA blog from yesterday seems to be on fire already, reprint approval requested by Christian Post, several bloggers already posted, other cool stuff, etc.

<Transgender and Gender Diverse Children and Adolescents Fact Checking of AAP Policy.pdf>
As I am actually right now skimming it to compare it to the 2018 version, I see just enough examples of very
slight phrasing changes and dropped phrases, that we need to not simply switch citations, but be sure we are
directly citing from this new version, The changes are few and slight and do not change meaning, but for
legal stuff, we need precision and accuracy lest the opponent latch on to gnats and pretend they are camels.
