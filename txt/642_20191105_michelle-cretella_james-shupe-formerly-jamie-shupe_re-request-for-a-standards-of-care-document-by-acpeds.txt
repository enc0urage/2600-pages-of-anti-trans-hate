Subject: Re: Request For A Standards Of Care Document By ACPeds

James,
Good to hear from you! No need to convince me of the need. Unfortunately, the American College of Pediatricians does
not have the bandwidth to do this. However, there is another recently formed group focused solely on this issue that
may attempt to draft alternative SOCs. Mike Laidlaw and Will Malone are active within it, I am less so.
Let me find out if the group is "out" yet.
Best,
Michelle

Hello Dr. Cretella,
I wanted to reach out and see if the medical association you are involved with would consider authoring a "standards of care" for people suffering from gender issues?
As you well know, WPATH has one, which is going to cause problems for litigants who have been harmed by gender ideology.
The following court document is provided for your review to show the need for such a document.
My best,
James Shupe

Note: James: The key language is "breach of the applicable standard of care". This is a brief filed by the VA in a recent Med Mal case in Florida. It is not a perfect resource, but it does show you some of the arguments
you are likely to face from the VA when you file.
