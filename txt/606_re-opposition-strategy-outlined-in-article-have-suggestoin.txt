Dr.Leena Nahata, a trans-affirmation advocate endocrinologist in Ohio, decried the use of puberty blockers in hyper-libidinous teenage boys with severe autism
because it was unethical to treat someone who could not consent to it legally while, at the same time, she is pushing for puberty blockers in trans kids in the early
stages of puberty. Can't make up this stuff!

In case it's not on the radar, the same folks arguing for chemical castration in children for
the purpose of gender confirmation are usually against the same thing being used on sex
offenders. The treatments are one and the same.

Exactly.

And even in the case of something like cancer, any sterilization is a side effect,
rather than a goal, of a treatment for other purposes. There's no directive that
children with cancer must be sterilized, and if doctors could prevent that outcome,
surely they would. For no other type of child is that considered a humane end goal of
treatment.

Fred and all,
CPR-C can prepare a rebuttal this week to the ACLU that Mary
(UCAL Berkely), Jane Robbins (Harvard Law), and I (Harvard Law,
Guardian ad Litem for children) can sign and send. I can ask
Kara Dansky (former ACLU lawyer) of Womens Liberation Front if
sheâ€™d be willing to sign from the left. Maryâ€™s email re:

involuntary sterilization would be key part of the response.
We also need to stress the point the the ACLU is entirely
missing the point of this bill â€” it nothing to do with
discriminating against any class of children, but rather
everything to do with protecting a vulnerable group of
children, and all children (given the social contagion). While
there may be a constitutional right to refuse to carry a child
to term (under Roe), there is no constitutional right to
chemically and surgically mutiliating oneâ€™s healthy body,
where there is no disease to be treated â€” that is child
abuse.
When would you need this?

On a different note, I have this new thread dispelling the "wrong puberty" argument.

Yes, and also point out that these procedures amount to involuntary sterilization
of minors. They cannot legally or psychologically consent. Their parents cannot
give informed consent since the knowledge necessary for informed consent does
not exist. The Supreme Court struck down laws providing for sterilization of serial
criminals in Skinner v. Oklahoma and mentally incompetent adults cannot be

sterilized even if their guardians consent without a court order. Are the ACLU
and similar groups advocating for involuntary sterilization of children? Also their
equal protection arguments are without merit. " Transchildren" are not being
treated differently from other children. In fact the opposite is true. This bill will
ensure that "transchildren" have the same protections from dangerous medical
experiments as do other children.

No doctor or parent has a right to subject a

with unknown long-term consequences.
Without this ban in place, SD will follow what
is already happening in other states: minors
who successfully sue in court to obtain this
supposedly "life-saving" medical intervention.
And when they grow up with irreversible
regret, who will be liable? The state.
This ban is also important to prevent custody
battles. We have several parents who have
reached out to the KC because of a former
spouse who is intent on medicalizing their
child. Finding an attorney to help is nearly as
difficult as finding a therapist. And even
when they do, who knows how a judge will
rule? Banning these procedures will take
these serious medical decisions away from
misinformed judges.
The claim that this is lifesaving medically
necessary intervention is the big
unchallenged domino that is driving both the
legal and medical scandal. This is an oftrepeated claim with no support and it must
be confronted directly.
