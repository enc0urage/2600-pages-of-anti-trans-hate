Subject: Re: Idaho Vital Statistics Integrity Act - short window for comments - by Friday, January 24

Dear Fred,

Please do not say that the South Dakota effort failed!!

You successfully inspired, encouraged and counseled numerous VCAP efforts around the country. You brought together
the brightest most experienced professions from coast to coast to sacrificially and generously provide numerous
white papers to persuade reticent legislators. You established the ideal witness list that we are all still
following in our individual states. You lead the way with creative media efforts that each of us have tailored to
our individual states and speakers. Your sacrifice of time, energy and resources was the epitome of servant
leadership. Your courage to confront this growing abomination in spite of the attacks has fortified many other
witnesses and legislative sponsors who have been attached knowing that you have gone before us. And, most
importantly you connected us all to each other.

This is just beginning.

Thank you Fred, et. All.

Thank you for your courage. Though our session in SD is now over and our efforts to protect gender-confused
vulnerable children failed, I continue to receive ugly email and social media posts. America needs more state
legislators like you. â€“ Fred Deutsch, South Dakota Rep.
