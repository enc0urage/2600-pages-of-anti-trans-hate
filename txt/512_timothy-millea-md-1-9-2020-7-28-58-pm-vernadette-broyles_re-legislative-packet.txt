Terrific information, particularly on background to support the position. Thank you for the obviously significant time and thought applied. Iâ€™m likely late to this â€œteamâ€​, but thanks to Fred and Michelle,
am grateful for all the expertise. There is a small but growing number of us in the Catholic Medical Association who are pushing this issue forward, and this type of information is great help in getting ahead of
it.
