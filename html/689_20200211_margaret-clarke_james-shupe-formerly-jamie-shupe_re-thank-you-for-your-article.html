James,
Thanks so much for sharing your thoughts. At this point we don’t have any transitions that are willing to testify at
all in Alabama. Thanks for the seasoned wisdom.

Margaret,
A thought to share while it&#x27;s on my mind. I don&#x27;t remember if you got to witness the blow-out I had with the
transsexual that Fred had testifying on behalf of his bill, but I think getting into bed with folks who are still
actively &quot;identifying&quot; as the opposite sex and or haven&#x27;t made any formal efforts to reclaim their birth sex, etc.,
is a really bad idea, and I highly discourage it. Not to mention, you run the risk of them turning over all the
communications to entities such as the ACLU as they&#x27;re happening or later.
In this case, I&#x27;m referring to Scott Newgent, the female that still identifies as a male.
It&#x27;s essentially putting someone on the witness stand and having them say &quot;this is bad unless you&#x27;re doing it like I
am as an adult.&quot; This is a really bad strategy when the opposition is making the case that they&#x27;re creating a better
version of that person who&#x27;s gonna suffer less and be spared the surgeries, have time to change their mind, etc.
See where I&#x27;m going with this?
So I not only think this is a bad idea, I flat out don&#x27;t trust these folks.
James

&gt; Thank you as well, Margaret, for your kind words and support.
&gt;
&gt; I prayed for Fred and the rest of you yesterday that have been willing to take on this big fight.
&gt;
&gt; Fred&#x27;s facing another hearing today, and I&#x27;m proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with all of you on this important
issue. You&#x27;re not wrong about this, it really is what needs to happen to protect these children and their parents.
&gt;
&gt; Blessings,
&gt;

&gt; Good morning James,
&gt;
&gt; Thank you for your precious message of redemption. I am leading a coalition her in Alabama to adopt a bill similar
to Rep. Fred Deutsch’s. He and Michelle have been coaching us. You will be on our prayer list. It is so encouraging
to see the genuine work of the Lord in your heart and your courage to admit failure. More importantly that Jesus
Christ is the sole help of you heart and sole. Heart change is the greatest miracle of all!! Your testimony gives
God great glory!!!
&gt;
&gt; Thank you so much,
&gt; Margaret
