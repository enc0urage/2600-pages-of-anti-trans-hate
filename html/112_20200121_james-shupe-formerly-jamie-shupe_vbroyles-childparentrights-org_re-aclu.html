I understand. You got to see how emotional and painful this was when I spoke at the Atlanta event this summer. It
really drains me but as I said if necessary and winning or losing is on the line don&#x27;t hesitate to contact me. I&#x27;ve
even turned down TV appearances in the past year because it&#x27;s so tough.

Hi Vernadette,
I live in Ocala, FL.
Honestly, I&#x27;m in intensive mental health therapy and it&#x27;s best that at least for now I don&#x27;t overly stress
myself. With my PTSD and anxiety disorder it takes a tremendous toll on me to do public appearances.
So if absolutely necessary I&#x27;ll do it but best to instead use my new court order as much as possible to get
it introduced into cases and legislative records, according to Richard Mast.

Is there any chance you would be willing to testify her in Georgia? We expect it would be sometime the
first week of February, but don’t have a specific date yet. Can we talk about this soon?
Please remind me what state you live in?

So the ACLU is giving out your home phone number, Fred?
“The time to act is now,” the ACLU of South Dakota tweeted. It followed with a long list of legislator’s home and office numbers.&quot;
