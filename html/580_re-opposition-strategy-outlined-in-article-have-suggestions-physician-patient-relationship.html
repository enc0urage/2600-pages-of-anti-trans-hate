Subject: Re: Opposition strategy outlined in article. Have suggestions? - Physician-Patient relationship
Just to play devil&#x27;s advocate, how can we justify male circumcision when the medical benefits of such are equivocal? Obviously, there is a GIANT difference in the outcome of removing
entire organs as opposed to just a bit of foreskin. I am thinking out loud about what the opposition might say in rebuttal.

The following is along the lines of what Kara, Natasha, and Michelle have been saying. In fact Michelle and I
and others once had a conversation about Olson-Kennedyâ€™s teen mastectomy study. We concluded that it is not
a scientific study at all, but a document filled with details of crimes by doctors against girls and young
women.
Here is my version rebutting the argument that this bill will cause an interference in the patient-physician
relationship:
Doctors who willfully harm patients are criminals. If a doctor drugs a patient unconscious and surgically
removes her 14 year old, healthy breasts, this is a criminal act. The 14 year old cannot freely give consent
to this procedure as she does not have the capacity to know what her self at age 25 or 30 years old would
want. She can never have functional breasts replaced. Women who thought they were trans have regretted this
happened to them. One such woman uses donor milk because she is physically incapable of producing milk after
her mastectomy.
Likewise an 11 or 12 year old cannot make an informed consent decision to stop normal puberty. Puberty
blockers lead in the majority of cases to sterilization and sexual dysfunction. A boy or a girl of that age
cannot possibly know or understand if their future self at age 25 or 30 would want a child and functional
sexual relationships. They are not developmentally able to make such a decision.
The physician who blocks normal puberty and places the child on a pathway to sterility - which is what
happens in the majority of cases - is a criminal.

The cases described here do not constitute healthy physician-patient relationships. Indeed these are not
physician-patient relationships at all, they are criminal-victim relationships. The physician who does
mastectomies of 14 year old breasts or provides 11 years old puberty blockers has willfully caused harm to a
child - notwithstanding the desires or knowledge of the parents or child! The child is simply not able to
consent to the harms that will result. Just as a girl could not possibly provide consent to female genital
mutilation in another context. No matter if the parents and doctors all sign forms in agreement.
The physician is ultimately responsible for the harms as he or she is the only one who can sign the
prescriptions and use the scalpels and surgical tools in the operating room. The physician is criminal in
these scenarios and must be prosecuted by the law.
A just society cannot allow children - who by nature do not have the cognitive and developmental capacity to
comprehend the damage to their bodies and reproductive capabilities - to undergo these harmful procedures.

Exactly.
And even in the case of something like cancer, any sterilization is a side effect,
rather than a goal, of a treatment for other purposes. There&#x27;s no directive that
children with cancer must be sterilized, and if doctors could prevent that outcome,
surely they would. For no other type of child is that considered a humane end goal of
treatment.

Fred and all,
CPR-C can prepare a rebuttal this week to the ACLU that Mary
(UCAL Berkely), Jane Robbins (Harvard Law), and I (Harvard Law,
Guardian ad Litem for children) can sign and send. I can ask
Kara Dansky (former ACLU lawyer) of Womens Liberation Front if
she&#x27;d be willing to sign from the left. Mary&#x27;s email re:
involuntary sterilization would be key part of the response. We
also need to stress the point the the ACLU is entirely missing
the point of this bill â€” it nothing to do with discriminating
against any class of children, but rather everything to do with
protecting a vulnerable group of children, and all children
(given the social contagion). While there may be a
constitutional right to refuse to carry a child to term (under
Roe), there is no constitutional right to chemically and
surgically mutiliating one&#x27;s healthy body, where there is no
disease to be treated â€” that is child abuse.
When would you need this?

Yes, and also point out that these procedures amount to involuntary sterilization
of minors. They cannot legally or psychologically consent. Their parents cannot
give informed consent since the knowledge necessary for informed consent does not
exist. The Supreme Court struck down laws providing for sterilization of serial
criminals in Skinner v. Oklahoma and mentally incompetent adults cannot be
sterilized even if their guardians consent without a court order. Are the ACLU and
similar groups advocating for involuntary sterilization of children? Also their equal
protection arguments are without merit. &quot; Transchildren&quot; are not being treated
differently from other children. In fact the opposite is true. This bill will ensure that
&quot;transchildren&quot; have the same protections from dangerous medical experiments as do
other children.

No doctor or parent has a right to subject a

child to a life-altering medical experiment with
unknown long-term consequences. Without this
ban in place, SD will follow what is already
happening in other states: minors who
successfully sue in court to obtain this
supposedly &quot;life-saving&quot; medical intervention.
And when they grow up with irreversible regret,
who will be liable? The state.
This ban is also important to prevent custody
battles. We have several parents who have
reached out to the KC because of a former
spouse who is intent on medicalizing their child.
Finding an attorney to help is nearly as difficult
as finding a therapist. And even when they do,
who knows how a judge will rule? Banning these
procedures will take these serious medical
decisions away from misinformed judges.
The claim that this is lifesaving medically
necessary intervention is the big unchallenged
domino that is driving both the legal and medical
scandal. This is an oft-repeated claim with no
support and it must be confronted directly.
