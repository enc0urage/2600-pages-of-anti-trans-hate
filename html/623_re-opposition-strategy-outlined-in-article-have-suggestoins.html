Fred and all,
CPR-C can prepare a rebuttal this week to the ACLU that Mary (UCAL Berkely), Jane Robbins (Harvard Law), and I
(Harvard Law, Guardian ad Litem for children) can sign and send. I can ask Kara Dansky (former ACLU lawyer) of
Womens Liberation Front if sheâ€™d be willing to sign from the left. Maryâ€™s email re: involuntary sterilization
would be key part of the response. We also need to stress the point the the ACLU is entirely missing the point of
this bill â€” it nothing to do with discriminating against any class of children, but rather everything to do with
protecting a vulnerable group of children, and all children (given the social contagion). While there may be a
constitutional right to refuse to carry a child to term (under Roe), there is no constitutional right to chemically
and surgically mutiliating oneâ€™s healthy body, where there is no disease to be treated â€” that is child abuse.
When would you need this?

Very well stated Mary.
On a different note, I have this new thread dispelling the &quot;wrong puberty&quot; argument.

Yes, and also point out that these procedures amount to involuntary sterilization of minors. They cannot legally or psychologically consent. Their parents cannot give informed
consent since the knowledge necessary for informed consent does not exist. The Supreme Court struck down laws providing for sterilization of serial criminals in Skinner v.
Oklahoma and mentally incompetent adults cannot be sterilized even if their guardians consent without a court order. Are the ACLU and similar groups advocating for involuntary
sterilization of children? Also their equal protection arguments are without merit. &quot; Transchildren&quot; are not being treated differently from other children. In fact the opposite is true.
This bill will ensure that &quot;transchildren&quot; have the same protections from dangerous medical experiments as do other children.

No doctor or parent has a right to subject a child to a life-altering medical experiment with unknown long-term consequences. Without this ban in place, SD will follow what is
already happening in other states: minors who successfully sue in court to obtain this supposedly &quot;life-saving&quot; medical intervention. And when they grow up with irreversible
regret, who will be liable? The state.
This ban is also important to prevent custody battles. We have several parents who have reached out to the KC because of a former spouse who is intent on medicalizing
their child. Finding an attorney to help is nearly as difficult as finding a therapist. And even when they do, who knows how a judge will rule? Banning these procedures will take
these serious medical decisions away from misinformed judges.
The claim that this is lifesaving medically necessary intervention is the big unchallenged domino that is driving both the legal and medical scandal. This is an oft-repeated claim
with no support and it must be confronted directly.

The ACLU have done as much as anyone could to make sure it&#x27;s impossible to define a class of persons under these laws.

Mike,
Look at the medical claim in that &quot;legal&quot; ACLU quote; it is false on multiple grounds
&quot;no such thing as a medically diagnosable group of trans anybody; we are talking about minors! blockers, wrong sex hormones and surgical mutilation are never medically
necessary in minors!&quot;

Legal experts have an opinion on that statement?
