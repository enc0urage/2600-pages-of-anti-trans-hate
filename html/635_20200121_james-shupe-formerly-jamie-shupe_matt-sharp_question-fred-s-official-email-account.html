Subject: Question: Fred&#x27;s Official Email Account
*EXTERNAL*

Matt,
I&#x27;ve been wondering, if the ACLU files suit, are they going to be able to obtain all of our emails because Fred is using his legislative email account?

Michelle,

Thank you for the reference to the American Psychiatric Association. We produced this memo a few years ago and were looking to demonstrate that even our opponents recognize the biological basis for
sex. I completely agree that we do not want to concede that sex is assigned at birth. Iâ€™ll update the memo with the reference you provided.
