Awesome article!
Particularly like the way it rips into the fallacies of gender identity.
I posted the piece in some of the main Rebbit subs, so hopefully, plenty of traffic will flow from that.

How’s it going with getting one consent form?

I am told two or three really good malpractice cases, particularly from minors with regret, and for Jane and Michael to get so much as one consent form from CH LA or UCSF, and it is game on.
It won’t be long.

Dear Team
After reading about the Oregon Hospital and their gender program, I can not describe the horror that I personally feel. My mental illness and gender dysphoria came out of a broken
home with a drunk for a father, and a mother who was mentally ill who sexually abused me. The mental torment that I felt growing up was horrific. GD has played a key part in all of
my relationships and life decisions.

To this very day I suffer from the consequences that GD has had on my life. But the doctors I dealt with were all, uniformly reluctant to allow any individual to pass through the
ultimate gate towards SRS. They all understood it was a last resort for the desperate.
And to think that any medical institution would further and promote the debacle that GD has on young people is nothing less than vile and despicable in the extreme .
I understand that multiple factors has caused ROGD epidemic. But for anyone in the medical community to do what Oregon medical community has done is criminal.
How can we stop this? We must stop this. How?

Sincerely

Rene Jax
