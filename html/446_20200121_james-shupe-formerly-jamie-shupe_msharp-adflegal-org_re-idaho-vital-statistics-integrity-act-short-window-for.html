Matt,
As I explained to Michelle, my new court order ADF helped secure contains language stating my sex was observed at
birth.

Michelle,

Thank you for the reference to the American Psychiatric Association. We produced this memo a few years ago and
were looking to demonstrate that even our opponents recognize the biological basis for sex. I completely agree
that we do not want to concede that sex is assigned at birth. Iâ€™ll update the memo with the reference you
provided.
