Hi James, I used this same article as a reference in a paper I recently submitted...hopefully, it’s worthy of
publishing.

Dr.Leena Nahata, a trans-affirmation advocate endocrinologist in Ohio, decried the use of puberty blockers in hyper-libidinous teenage boys with severe autism because it

In case it&#x27;s not on the radar, the same folks arguing for chemical castration in children for the
purpose of gender confirmation are usually against the same thing being used on sex offenders. The
treatments are one and the same.

Exactly.
And even in the case of something like cancer, any sterilization is a side effect, rather
than a goal, of a treatment for other purposes. There&#x27;s no directive that children with
cancer must be sterilized, and if doctors could prevent that outcome, surely they would.
For no other type of child is that considered a humane end goal of treatment.

Fred and all,
CPR-C can prepare a rebuttal this week to the ACLU that Mary (UCAL
Berkely), Jane Robbins (Harvard Law), and I (Harvard Law, Guardian
ad Litem for children) can sign and send. I can ask Kara Dansky
(former ACLU lawyer) of Womens Liberation Front if she’d be willing
to sign from the left. Mary’s email re: involuntary sterilization
would be key part of the response. We also need to stress the point
the the ACLU is entirely missing the point of this bill — it nothing
to do with discriminating against any class of children, but rather
everything to do with protecting a vulnerable group of children,
and all children (given the social contagion). While there may be a
constitutional right to refuse to carry a child to term (under Roe),
there is no constitutional right to chemically and surgically
mutiliating one’s healthy body, where there is no disease to be
treated — that is child abuse.
When would you need this?

Yes, and also point out that these procedures amount to involuntary sterilization of
minors. They cannot legally or psychologically consent. Their parents cannot give
informed consent since the knowledge necessary for informed consent does not exist.
The Supreme Court struck down laws providing for sterilization of serial criminals in
Skinner v. Oklahoma and mentally incompetent adults cannot be sterilized even if their
guardians consent without a court order. Are the ACLU and similar groups advocating
for involuntary sterilization of children? Also their equal protection arguments are without
merit. &quot; Transchildren&quot; are not being treated differently from other children. In fact the
opposite is true. This bill will ensure that &quot;transchildren&quot; have the same protections from
dangerous medical experiments as do other children.

No doctor or parent has a right to subject a child to
a life-altering medical experiment with unknown
long-term consequences. Without this ban in place,
SD will follow what is already happening in other
states: minors who successfully sue in court to
obtain this supposedly &quot;life-saving&quot; medical
intervention. And when they grow up with
irreversible regret, who will be liable? The state.
This ban is also important to prevent custody
battles. We have several parents who have reached
out to the KC because of a former spouse who is
intent on medicalizing their child. Finding an attorney
to help is nearly as difficult as finding a therapist.
And even when they do, who knows how a judge will
rule? Banning these procedures will take these
serious medical decisions away from misinformed
judges.

The claim that this is lifesaving medically necessary
intervention is the big unchallenged domino that is
driving both the legal and medical scandal. This is an
oft-repeated claim with no support and it must be
confronted directly.
