Yes, we can pretty much guess what that study actually looked at and actually showed, but what is the citation
anyway?
Itâ€™s typical emotional blackmail and raises more questions than it answers.
As for quick replies (all bold highlighting is mine, otherwise quotes are quotes):
If their study they cite shows a 48% reduction in suicide attempts (like, what, one year out?):

A 2011 Swedish study of post-gender-reassignment adults showed a suicide rate 19 times (1,900%) that of the general population after 10 years. This was a
30-year population-based matched cohort study of all 324 sex-reassigned persons in Sweden.
(Dhejne C, et al, â€œLong-Term Follow-Up of Transsexual Persons Undergoing Sex Reassignment Surgery: Cohort Study in Sweden,â€​ journals.plos.org, Feb. 22,
2011.)
Bailey and Blanchard: â€œThere is no persuasive evidence that gender transition reduces gender dysphoric childrenâ€™s likelihood of killing
themselves.â€​â€¦
â€œThe idea that mental health problemsâ€“including suicidalityâ€“are caused by gender dysphoria rather than the other way around â€¦ is currently
popular and politically correct. It is, however, unproven and as likely to be false as true.â€​
(J. Michael Bailey and Ray Blanchard, â€œSuicide or transition: The only options for gender dysphoric kids?â€​ 4thwavenow.com, Sept. 8, 2017.
https://4thwavenow.com/2017/09/08/suicide-or-transition-the-only-options-for-gender-dysphoric-kids/)
â€œParadox. The suicide rate for AYA in the non-affirming 1950s USA was much lower than it is now. For both sexes, it was only 4.5 suicides per 100,000
AYA.â€​
Peaked in 1994 with a combined rate of 13.6; â€¦declined slightly and then was more or less flat until 2011, when it began again to climb.â€​
(Hacsi Horvath, Dec. 19, 2018.(https://4thwavenow.com/2018/12/19/the-theatre-of-the-body-a-detransitioned-epidemiologist-examines-suicidality-affirmationand-transgender-identity/)
The point from Hacsi is why werenâ€™t the 1950s a total blood bath for suicides if non-affirmation of everything is the fast train to offing oneâ€™s self? Affirmation
was about nil. For the past decade GLBT affirmation has steadily increased while suicides have too. What gives then?

Probably not appropriate to contact ACLU. They claim suicidal thoughts and attempts reduce when families affirm their gender identity. Our bill does not prevent that. It only prevents
medicalization. Family love, support and social transition is not addressed by our bill. - Fred
