Friends,
On April 4th, I will give a 45 min power point presentation to the Committee of 10 Bishops from the United States
Council of Catholic Bishops that is responsible for drafting transgender guidelines for America&#x27;s Catholic
Hospitals, physicians and health systems.
I am entitling it &quot;A Cry for Help NOT Hormones&quot; and will cover the science as it pertains to kids &amp; adults;
underlying (anti-Christian) worldview and societal ramifications.
Would the four of you allow me to use a head shot of each of you on my title slide? I want the Bishops to know I am
talking about REAL people.
Michelle
-Sincerely
