Subject: Re: update

IMO, as Fred pointed out earlier, the definition of sex in the bill as &quot; the biological state of being female or male, based on sex
organs, chromosomes, and endogenous hormone profiles&quot; - covers all bases. A boy who perceives himself as a girl and requests
blockers &amp; estrogen will be denied under this bill.
&quot;Biological sex&quot; is redundant and may be used to imply there are other sexes like a social sex; &quot;natal or birth sex&quot;
implies sex can change before or after birth ...

My opinion is to cover your bases in the mentioned line as well. I think that sentence is too ambiguous and should get reworded.
It says: “attempting to change or affirm the child’s perception of their sex.&quot; So if a male child&#x27;s perception of their sex is female?
I like what Andre suggested, but recommend changing natal to biological, based on court language.

Don’t you think that covers it? - Fred
