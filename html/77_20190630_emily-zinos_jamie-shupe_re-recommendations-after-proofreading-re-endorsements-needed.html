I am excited to let you know that I am getting very close to the finish line with a tool I&#x27;ve been developing called the Parent Resource Guide. I&#x27;ve attached the Guide below for you to look through when you have time.

I&#x27;m hoping to get a few different organizations to co-brand the guide, with two from the left or center and two from the right, so as to widen our audience. Know that there may be some minor changes to text as the cobranders weigh in on the Guide. Also, I had to switch graphic designers at the last minute, so please know that some design elements may also change (the cover will most definitely be changing, fyi).

Please don&#x27;t share the Guide at this point, but do let me know if you think of someone else I should ask for an endorsement. We&#x27;re hoping to have all endorsements by July 15th.
