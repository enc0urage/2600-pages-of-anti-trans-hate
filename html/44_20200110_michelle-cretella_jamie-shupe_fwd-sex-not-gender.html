Thank you Michelle. We did not know that this bill was on the table. We have plans to contact the
Senator\Represenative involved.. Unfortunately, as you know, I am leaving the country and may not be able to do
anything until I get back. I will copy Eunie and Becky on this warning. Thanks so much. God bless you,

Margaret,
I hope that your AL Eagle Forum can educate legislators and I will mention the importance of language at the
St. Louis Meeting. This is unfortunate re: AL &quot;GIRL ACT&quot; (see below by James Shupe - the former first legally
recognized &quot;non-binary&quot; American who came to embrace reality and Christ, and just won the legal right to
change his legal sex designation back to male). I am not sure we can correct the GIRL ACT (I&#x27;ve not been able
to give that thought yet).
In a nutshell: Sex is real, physical ... gender is SUBJECTIVE heavily rooted in sex stereotypes - we can have
feminine appearing men; masculine appearing women but sex trumps gender in sports (and reality generally).
Gender is a poisonous word.
Best,
Michelle

All,
Speaking of legislative issues. Please do your best to educate lawmakers and others in the harm of using the word gender instead of sex.
This is Exhibit A from yesterday&#x27;s news: “Gender is Real Legislative (GIRL) Act”
https://www.al.com/news/2020/01/alabama-lawmaker-aims-to-keep-transgender-athletes-off-school-teams.html
I shared this with Roger Brooks earlier.
The legal definition of gender only listed “masculine, feminine or neuter” to establish that state law applied equally to men and women, even when masculine pronouns were used, the Tuesday
opinion said.
The appellate panel instead based its reasoning on the dictionary meaning of the word “gender” in 1988, which limited the meaning to “sex,” or the “biological roles of male and female.”
To assume that the 1988 use of “gender” in the ethnic intimidation law encompassed transgender individuals “strains credulity” and so the law cannot be applied to Steuball’s case, Gadola
wrote.

Similarly, as training materials are produced, it would be great to create some stuff about the dirty and inconsistent history of gender identity to educate lawmakers and give
them talking points, something I&#x27;ve come to believe many policymaker are not familiar with.
I&#x27;ve started plugging all the inconsistent definitions of gender identity into this site of mine.
We&#x27;ve gone from the John Money days of transsexuals having a gender identity to it now being claimed that well have a gender identity. Then around 2011, the other 80 or so
flavors of gender started getting unleashed and backed by the APA, etc.

The language matters. Every time we use the words gender or gender identity we are advancing the ideology as real and legit Apologies if I come off as preaching on this one,
but I&#x27;m proof of the harm.
Blessings,
James
