Subject: Re: Sex Not Gender

I&#x27;m with you James. That&#x27;s why I called it the &quot;Gender Identity Phantom&quot; in one of my articles. An unprovable
unreality.
Thanks for everything you&#x27;re doing. My wife saw an article about your recent court decision. She said &quot;have you
heard of this guy?&quot; Ah, yes I said, we&#x27;re on many email chains. Glad to be so. Thanks again.

All,
Speaking of legislative issues. Please do your best to educate lawmakers and others in the harm of using the word gender instead of sex.
This is Exhibit A from yesterday&#x27;s news: &quot;Gender is Real Legislative (GIRL) Act&quot;

I shared this with Roger Brooks earlier.
The legal definition of gender only listed &quot;masculine, feminine or neuter&quot; to establish that state law applied equally to men and women, even when masculine pronouns were used, the Tuesday opinion
said.
The appellate panel instead based its reasoning on the dictionary meaning of the word &quot;gender&quot; in 1988, which limited the meaning to &quot;sex,&quot; or the &quot;biological roles of male and female.&quot;
To assume that the 1988 use of &quot;gender&quot; in the ethnic intimidation law encompassed transgender individuals &quot;strains credulity&quot; and so the law cannot be applied to Steuball&#x27;s case, Gadola wrote.

Similarly, as training materials are produced, it would be great to create some stuff about the dirty and inconsistent history of gender identity to educate lawmakers and give them talking
points, something I&#x27;ve come to believe many policymaker are not familiar with.
I&#x27;ve started plugging all the inconsistent definitions of gender identity into this site of mine.
We&#x27;ve gone from the John Money days of transsexuals having a gender identity to it now being claimed that well have a gender identity. Then around 2011, the other 80 or so flavors of
gender started getting unleashed and backed by the APA, etc.

The language matters. Every time we use the words gender or gender identity we are advancing the ideology as real and legit Apologies if I come off as preaching on this one, but I&#x27;m

proof of the harm.
Blessings,
James
