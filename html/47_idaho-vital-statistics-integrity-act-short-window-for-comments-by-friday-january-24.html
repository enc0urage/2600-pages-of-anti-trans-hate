All,
All,
Please meet Steve Smith, an Idaho allied attorney, and Idaho Representative Julianne Young. They have been working on a birth certificate protection bill, to reverse a recent court decision striking down sexbased birth certificates in Idaho. This will restore the status quo, making Idaho one of four states that require birth certificates to reflect sex, along with Kansas, Ohio, and Tennessee.

Julianne has a short window to receive comments (especially desired from the medical experts).

Matt Sharp provided ADF factual findings for the recitals and some edits. I have accepted his changes; made a few suggested edits of my own, and thus open it up to you all for any input for Julianne and Steve.

There may be an opportunity for expert testimony, but I leave the details on that to Rep. Young.
