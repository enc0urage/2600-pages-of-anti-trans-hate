Subject: Re: Opposition strategy outlined in article. Have suggestions? - Physician-Patient relationship

Thanks, mike; you raise an excellent point, and that is worth working in. The point I was indirectly making is that
doctors are speaking from their strength when you speak to medicine and patients, but seemed unduly strident and
accusatory when you deem other doctors as criminals out the gate. Better to make the medical case, then bring the
law in as an aid to protecting the practice of medicine rather than making particular doctors become criminals.

That’s an excellent line Gary. And I suppose my language would be seen as to stark and harsh, particularly coming from a physician. Though I was more so putting out ideas for Fred to
consider.

Stepping back a bit though, philosophically, we are trying to make something to be recognized as a crime by the legal system. But is a crime not a crime if it is not yet “on the books”? Seems
as though it has to be said somehow that these are crimes waiting to be recognized and codified into law. Perhaps it could be stated in a less inflammatory way then what I’ve written.

The following is along the lines of what Kara, Natasha, and Michelle have been saying. In fact Michelle and I and others once had a conversation about Olson-Kennedy&#x27;s teen mastectomy
study. We concluded that it is not a scientific study at all, but a document filled with details of crimes by doctors against girls and young women.
Here is my version rebutting the argument that this bill will cause an interference in the patient-physician relationship:
Doctors who willfully harm patients are criminals. If a doctor drugs a patient unconscious and surgically removes her 14 year old, healthy breasts, this is a criminal act. The 14 year old
cannot freely give consent to this procedure as she does not have the capacity to know what her self at age 25 or 30 years old would want. She can never have functional breasts
replaced. Women who thought they were trans have regretted this happened to them. One such woman uses donor milk because she is physically incapable of producing milk after her
mastectomy.
Likewise an 11 or 12 year old cannot make an informed consent decision to stop normal puberty. Puberty blockers lead in the majority of cases to sterilization and sexual dysfunction. A boy

or a girl of that age cannot possibly know or understand if their future self at age 25 or 30 would want a child and functional sexual relationships. They are not developmentally able to
make such a decision.
The physician who blocks normal puberty and places the child on a pathway to sterility - which is what happens in the majority of cases - is a criminal.
The cases described here do not constitute healthy physician-patient relationships. Indeed these are not physician-patient relationships at all, they are criminal-victim relationships. The
physician who does mastectomies of 14 year old breasts or provides 11 years old puberty blockers has willfully caused harm to a child - notwithstanding the desires or knowledge of the
parents or child! The child is simply not able to consent to the harms that will result. Just as a girl could not possibly provide consent to female genital mutilation in another context. No
matter if the parents and doctors all sign forms in agreement.
The physician is ultimately responsible for the harms as he or she is the only one who can sign the prescriptions and use the scalpels and surgical tools in the operating room. The physician
is criminal in these scenarios and must be prosecuted by the law.
A just society cannot allow children - who by nature do not have the cognitive and developmental capacity to comprehend the damage to their bodies and reproductive capabilities - to
undergo these harmful procedures.

Exactly.
And even in the case of something like cancer, any sterilization is a side effect, rather than a goal, of a treatment for other purposes. There&#x27;s no directive that children with cancer
must be sterilized, and if doctors could prevent that outcome, surely they would. For no other type of child is that considered a humane end goal of treatment.

Fred and all,
CPR-C can prepare a rebuttal this week to the ACLU that Mary (UCAL Berkely), Jane Robbins (Harvard Law), and I (Harvard Law, Guardian ad Litem for children) can sign and
send. I can ask Kara Dansky (former ACLU lawyer) of Womens Liberation Front if she&#x27;d be willing to sign from the left. Mary&#x27;s email re: involuntary sterilization would be key part
of the response. We also need to stress the point the the ACLU is entirely missing the point of this bill — it nothing to do with discriminating against any class of children, but
rather everything to do with protecting a vulnerable group of children, and all children (given the social contagion). While there may be a constitutional right to refuse to carry
a child to term (under Roe), there is no constitutional right to chemically and surgically mutiliating one&#x27;s healthy body, where there is no disease to be treated — that is child
abuse.
When would you need this?

Yes, and also point out that these procedures amount to involuntary sterilization of minors. They cannot legally or psychologically consent. Their parents cannot give
informed consent since the knowledge necessary for informed consent does not exist. The Supreme Court struck down laws providing for sterilization of serial criminals in
Skinner v. Oklahoma and mentally incompetent adults cannot be sterilized even if their guardians consent without a court order. Are the ACLU and similar groups advocating
for involuntary sterilization of children? Also their equal protection arguments are without merit. &quot; Transchildren&quot; are not being treated differently from other children. In fact
the opposite is true. This bill will ensure that &quot;transchildren&quot; have the same protections from dangerous medical experiments as do other children.

No doctor or parent has a right to subject a child to a life-altering medical experiment with unknown long-term consequences. Without this ban in place, SD will follow
what is already happening in other states: minors who successfully sue in court to obtain this supposedly &quot;life-saving&quot; medical intervention. And when they grow up with
irreversible regret, who will be liable? The state.
This ban is also important to prevent custody battles. We have several parents who have reached out to the KC because of a former spouse who is intent on
medicalizing their child. Finding an attorney to help is nearly as difficult as finding a therapist. And even when they do, who knows how a judge will rule? Banning these
procedures will take these serious medical decisions away from misinformed judges.
The claim that this is lifesaving medically necessary intervention is the big unchallenged domino that is driving both the legal and medical scandal. This is an oftrepeated claim with no support and it must be confronted directly.

Look at the medical claim in that &quot;legal&quot; ACLU quote; it is false on multiple grounds
&quot;no such thing as a medically diagnosable group of trans anybody; we are talking about minors! blockers, wrong sex hormones and surgical mutilation are never
medically necessary in minors!&quot;
