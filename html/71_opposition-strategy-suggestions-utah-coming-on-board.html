Subject: Opposition Strategy Suggestions: Utah Coming On Board
This is another one of their vulnerable talking points:
&quot;Katie Matheson, communications director of Alliance for a Better Utah, called the bill “yet another example of politicians unnecessarily inserting themselves into the patient-family-doctor
relationship.”
https://www.heraldextra.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/orem-lawmaker-drafting-bill-to-ban-hormone-therapy-surgery-for/article_c633b971-98b3-5281-ab76-204cb7cf000c.html
Because trans activists have pushed really hard to have hormones prescriptions lowered from endocrinology, where they belong, to primary care, where most doctors are clueless about
the drugs and the dosages. The VA did this and it&#x27;s how I ended up with estrogen levels of 2,583 and blood clots in my eyes instead of a max level of 200.

Dear Scott,
That was not me. I actually agreed with you that it could be powerful for public to hear trans adults outline
horrors of transitioning and be against this for kids.
Sincerely,
Michelle

I&#x27;m going to respectfully disagree with that, and I&#x27;ll explain why.

I was recruited heavily by the Transsexual Global Alliance and I&#x27;ve largely ignored them. I have never heard your name or ever considered reaching out to you

There&#x27;s no shortage of transsexuals willing to denounce ( publically, that is not true)the medicalization of children, but their endorsements come with a hitch: they expect everyone to play make believe that they really are the
opposite sex and have compelled pronouns and all that garbage. Even worse, they pitch themselves as the real deal, the true transsexuals that had to transition. People like me they claim have sexual paraphilias and fetishes,
while they were born in the wrong body.

I do not believe I am a biological male
I do not condone sexual paraphilias or fetishes or
I am not the pronoun police

Please send me a link to this organization you are speaking of because it&#x27;s definitely not mine.

So I encourage all of you to not buy into this Trojan Horse ploy, because the actions of these folks &quot;identifying&quot; as the opposite sex is contributing immensely to the harm being done to females. It&#x27;s part of our fight, in fact.

Walt Heyer is proof that no matter how far you&#x27;ve gone medically, you can still turn back.

So unless they&#x27;ve taken formal steps to reclaim their birth sex and denounce gender ideology, please don&#x27;t endorse or indulge these persons.

Or contribute to the Blaire White types profiteering from this type of behavior.

Iâ€™ll let Scott make the call. There is no quid pro quo. Just a desire to help kids. - Fred
