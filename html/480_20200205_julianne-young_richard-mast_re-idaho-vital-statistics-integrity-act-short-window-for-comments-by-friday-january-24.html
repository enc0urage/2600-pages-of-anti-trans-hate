My apologies if this is redundant. I have tried to &#x27;reply all&#x27; in order to share this with the larger group but I&#x27;m not sure that it worked. If you could ensure that the larger group has access to this request
I would appreciate it. Thanks so much.
Our vital statistics folks in the Department of Health and Welfare have raised some questions which we have attempted to address in the attached draft. Their comments focused primarily on 39-245A
(4) and (5).
They wanted to ensure that the language stipulated that the affidavit be one provided by the department and asked that we make some changes in formatting to make the process more clear to the
public. I believe the changes to (4) are straightforward.
They raised some good questions regarding (5) though:
1- Our current language does not require verification from a medical professional that the appropriate chromosomal analysis and evaluation of anatomy has taken place and that the decision of sex is
appropriate based on that analysis and evaluation.
2- Our language is silent about what happens if they don&#x27;t resolve the indeterminate status within the three years. Do we need to specify that it can be resoled in court after this? Do we need to specify
any requirements should that be the case?
The drafter and I took a stab at it in the attached draft. Again, feedback is appreciated. Thank you to those who are providing review on this!
Representative Young
