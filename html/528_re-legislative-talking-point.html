Jamie is 100% correct. For there Libertarians, we should point out there is a host of things government
appropriately takes off of parentsâ€™ shoulders because it sends a societal message of the potential harm or
importance to children if too much decision-making is reposed in the hands of developing humans at too early an age.
Hence, parents need not fight with children about having to attend school, taking the car keys out of their hands
before age 16 and legal drivers license awarded, drinking before age 21, illegal drugs, entering into most
contracts, and others. Parents can rely on sound laws to back them up against the immature and manipulable wants
and decisions of their minor children. Thatâ€™s a good thing.
Great talking point, in my view.

All,
I&#x27;d like to bounce a potential talking point off of all you and hear your feedback. I&#x27;ve attached a screenshot of the typical turmoil in the homes of these kids with gender confusion
issues.
My talking point is, the state stepping in and creating regulatory law via the legislators such as Rep. Deutsch and others is actually taking the heat off of the parents to allow
these dangerous medical interventions for kids. This type of legislation essentially shifts the responsibility to the person wanting the treatment to when they become of legal age
in their state to get it. Once passed, it&#x27;s no longer their parents saying no, it&#x27;s the state.
For example, we don&#x27;t have kids and families in turmoil because children can&#x27;t drink, that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s not their parents stopping them from drinking, it&#x27;s a state law.
Am I making sense here?
Because with these unscrupulous medical providers on standby to give these harmful drugs to children as soon as a parent says yes, it&#x27;s the uncooperative parents that are
taking the heat whenever they say no. Peers getting the treatment only worsens this scenario.
For the record, I&#x27;m not just bringing this up as a talking point, I believe in what I&#x27;m saying here based on what I see online and in the news.
Blessings,
James
