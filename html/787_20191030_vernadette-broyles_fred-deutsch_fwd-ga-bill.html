Subject: Fwd: GA bill

Team

Truth is arising in Georgia! Representative Earhart, with whom Jane Robbins and I met a couple of weeks ago, released this press statement today. She is filing our bill this legislative session in Georgia.

Kudos to Quentin, who makes a powerful statement in support of this bill right out the starting gate! You all should know that Ginny (Rep. Earhart) beat her Democratic opponent last year in a very purple district within the
city limits of Atlanta who was a trans-activist parent campaigning on this issue. Ginny stood passionately and courageously on the truth and beat her. She is a fantastic God-choice to carry this bill forward. And sheâ€™s
working with Fred too.

Am stoked for what God is doing in Georgia â€” including a stall to the trans activist agenda in Pickens County (weâ€™re on it)! And intercessors are praying. Please add us and Rep. Ginny Earhart to your prayer teams
around the country.

Quentin â€” May need your help on Pickens County - will be in touch.

Blessings to all!
