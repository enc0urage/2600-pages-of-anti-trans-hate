Subject: Endocrine Society&#x27;s Latest Slime

Have you guys seen this garbage that just got released?
&quot;Endocrine Society urges policymakers to follow science on transgender health&quot;
&quot;Considerable scientific evidence has emerged demonstrating a durable biological element underlying gender identity.
There do not seem to be external forces that genuinely cause individuals to change gender identity. The Endocrine
Society called for policies to reflect this reality in our position statement on transgender health.&quot;
So what exactly is the science?
Following the trail leads to their position statement:
https://www.endocrine.org/advocacy/priorities-and-positions/transgender-health
Saraswat A, et al. Evidence Supporting the Biologic Nature of Gender Identity. Endocr Pract. 2015 Feb;21(2): 199204.
So who authored the study?
No surprises to find Joshua Safer but who&#x27;s this Jamie Weinand guy?
https://journals.aace.com/doi/abs/10.4158/EP14351.RA
A transgender man...
&quot;Jamie Weinand is a fourth-year med student and a trans man.&quot;

Seem Kristina Olson can&#x27;t find the evidence:
&quot;Thus, whereas the topic is an active line of work in many research laboratories around the world, definitive
conclusions about genetic and neural correlates of gender identity remain elusive.&quot;
