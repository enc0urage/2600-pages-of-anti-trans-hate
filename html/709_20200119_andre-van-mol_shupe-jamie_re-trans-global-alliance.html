Ah, there I can help. He advises business/corporations on security. Former investigator in San Fran. Cost of living
is very low in Viet Nam compared to US, and so he is not in the squeeze Hacsi is in financially. Plans to move to
the Malay border with Singapore. Thus all the conveniences of Singapore are proximal while the cost is minimal.
Also, as you likely noticed, he is rather doomy and gloomy that the USA is not just in decline but going down. Thus
the “move to a farm and raise pigs” bit he repeats for how people can guard their kids against the trans movement.

Andre,
On a side note, you can imagine what my thoughts are in regard to why someone like Jax would be in a place like Vietnam? AKA, sex tourism countries.

Jamie,
I and Michael Laidlaw spent an entire day in Sacramento with Jackie/Rene and had several/many e-mail exchanges with him. He testified that day along with Michael (admittedly, I was there in case something
dropped and I needed to fill in). Also, he was shopping for prices on detransing surgeries, waiting on Medicare to kick in, and seemed to be considering the timing to detrans. He’s got rough edges O plenty and
admits it. He mostly lives in Viet Nam these days, which is no place to engage elective surgeries. Yes, he’ surely a work in progress. I don’t know Scott — though I suspect diagnostic items about Scott — so
I cannot compare them.
I think the elitism and emotional lability of the way trans activists reflects narcissism, narcissistic wounding, emotional immaturity, adverse childhood events, and so forth. All here know the studies showing
enormous rates of personality disorders, most likely narcissistic, and Zucker and Blanchard don’t seem shy about saying that either. But, we can’t fix personality disorders for someone else.
I’m reading in Proverbs these days and there are repeated verses about holding one’s tongue, not engaging the foolish, and so forth, so for this SD battle and likely the one’s in Texas and Georgia, I’ll be
focusing on holding my tongue while simply maintaining certain lines without dismissing people. Narcissists who don’t get their way but are not dismissed outright have a tendency of moving on when they see
they simply won’t get to be the prima donna of the opera.

Michelle,
I, in turn, apologize for probably coming off as heavy-handed in this discussion but I&#x27;ve done so because I believe it&#x27;s vital we recognize a big problem and work to

alleviate it before it sinks the ship. The ACLU is literally loading the printers and scouting for frontmen attorneys in these states as we speak.
Rene Jax is another Scott.
Watch this clip at the time mark I&#x27;m posting it at.
https://youtu.be/-pxxBQm114k?t=1241
Just like Scott, Jax isn&#x27;t willing like Walt Heyer to reclaim his birth sex: a sign of a true ally. Instead Jax claims to be the &quot;real deal&quot; that I warned about when calling
out Scott. These folks have an elitist mentality among transsexuals. Everyone else isn&#x27;t legit for some reason or other, but they are the &quot;true transsexuals&quot; that benefit
from transition because they really are the opposite sex.

I&#x27;m quoting Scott here:
&quot;But, if we turn it around after we shut it down and talk to the ADULT TRANSGENDER PEOPLE, like me and say,&quot;
&quot;Listen, some adults need to transition to find peace in their lives. I, we understand that we have a transgender person on our panel. Our opinions
don&#x27;t have anything to do with being against the transgender community. We have dozens of transgender adults supporting us because they understand
the severity of medical transitioning. What we are saying is that NO ONE has the right to chose to be locked into the medical system, have less than
100% healthy bodies and decide to put themselves there for life than an adult about their own lives.
Here&#x27;s how this should be addressed. Even if you can somehow justify the &quot;trans&quot; medical treatments for consenting adults, it&#x27;s medical malpractice to
indulge the delusion that the person has a gender identity and &quot;affirm&quot; that false identity in your words and actions.
I wrested with: Do I want to say it behind Scott&#x27;s back or in her face?&quot; Am I correct that Scott is an FTM? And I decided if I wasn&#x27;t willing to say it in
Scott&#x27;s face, I shouldn&#x27;t say it at all.
Scott can be dropped with a simple explanation that endorsing Scott&#x27;s gender ideology has negative effects on females, example sports, etc.
Again, the ACLU and the AMA are gonna testify that building Scott at a young age is better and healthier, spares the surgeries and produces a better
cosmetic product.

I Understand what you are both saying; you are right.
BUT you both made comments to ENTIRE email string - it is not wise to essentially “dis” Scott in front of entire team when the bill is to be defended in
committee Wednesday with Scott’s testimony as part of Fred’s strategy. Better to have shot me down with Scott out of the string and debated strategy
with Fred alone.

Fred and Michelle,
I understand. Fred has far and away done the heavy lifting on this fantastic project. I am completely OK following the lead and rules he establishes.
Alliances can be fragile and it’s best that, as this bill goes, we stick to the small scope program in order to establish the greater goal.
As an aside, we have already seen Scott several times pigeonhole this bill into trans ideology with glowing Pro trans language, aside from GAT in kids.
Again, I think he’s a loose cannon. However , Fred, you know him better than anyone and I trust your judgment in getting this bill passed into law.
