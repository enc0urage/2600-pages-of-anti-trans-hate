Subject: Re: New Florida DSD/Gender Identity Case

James Liberty Counsel has been involved in the Florida bills from day one.
I just spent 3 days there with the men who drafted the bills including having dinner with them two nights in a row
to answer questions from my perspective.
Sill the bills are not perfect by any means but a step in the right direction

Richard,
Can Liberty Counsel please consider filing something in this case?
If a judge signs this thing, they&#x27;re going to do major damage in Florida and it&#x27;s no doubt leading to an effort for an X marker on licenses.

There is only one type of gonadal tissue in Klinefelter syndrome- a testicle! This is NOT intersex. The transactivists are using this male as a pawn.

It looks like gender activists are trying to pull the same scam here in Florida that&#x27;s going on with the State Department over passports in the ZZyym case.
A male born with Klinefelters syndrome is claiming to be female using gender identity and estrogen.
They want a Florida judge to sign off so they can use it go after Alabama birth certificates. Of course, this case will have profound effects on Florida too.
Born James: &quot; She was born with an extra chromosome, making her “intersex.”
&quot; But because Mayfield was born intersex, she didn’t require surgery, only estrogen.&quot;
