@FredDeutsch: Jon Uhler, passed along conversation beteen you two. I think it would be helpful for you to share your story over the phone during committee testimony in January. Total time for our side will be 20 mons, so it will break down to 2-3 mins per speaker. Emotional, honest human stories will be important for us. I am emailing you drafts of the bill and the white paper I am usning to educate legislators.- Fred
