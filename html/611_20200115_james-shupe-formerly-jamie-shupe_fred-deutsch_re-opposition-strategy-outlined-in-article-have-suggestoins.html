Understood, I think you know I was being sarcastic. I sent that because I wasn&#x27;t sure if you knew Bruce had committed suicide?
Which all goes back to my earlier links. These activists and trans organizations blame society or lack of family acceptance, or they didn&#x27;t get this or they didn&#x27;t get that, but it&#x27;s the mental
illness behind it all that driving the suicides.
