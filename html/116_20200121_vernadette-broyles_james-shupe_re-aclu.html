Jamie
I do not want to compromise your mental health.
Know that I and others are praying for you.

I would only reach out again if we are in dire need here in GA.

Hi Vernadette,
I live in Ocala, FL.
Honestly, I&#x27;m in intensive mental health therapy and it&#x27;s best that at least for now I don&#x27;t overly stress
myself. With my PTSD and anxiety disorder it takes a tremendous toll on me to do public appearances.
So if absolutely necessary I&#x27;ll do it but best to instead use my new court order as much as possible to get
it introduced into cases and legislative records, according to Richard Mast.

Is there any chance you would be willing to testify her in Georgia? We expect it would be sometime the
first week of February, but don’t have a specific date yet. Can we talk about this soon?
Please remind me what state you live in?

So the ACLU is giving out your home phone number, Fred?
“The time to act is now,” the ACLU of South Dakota tweeted. It followed with a long list of legislator’s home and office numbers.&quot;
