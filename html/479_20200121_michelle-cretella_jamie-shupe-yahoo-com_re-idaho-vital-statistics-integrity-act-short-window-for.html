Michelle,
Speaking of the sex assigned at birth issue, I made sure my new Oregon order used the phrase observed at birth.

Richard,
Thank you to all who are making this happen!

Re: the bill itself, I am not convinced that the specific DSDs should be named and described (section 5) and
defer to Dr. Paul Hruz&#x27;s expertise. Otherwise, I believe that it looks good.
Re: ADF PDF: In Section 2, Matt has quoted the American PSYCHOLOGICAL Association defining sex as &quot;assigned at
birth&quot; - I am pasting the section below:
The same is true of a person’s sex. Sex is binary (male or female), fixed, and objectively verifiable. One’s sex
is genetically established at conception, ascertained at or (via sonogram or genetic testing) before birth, and
may be verified by objective factors such as chromosomes, gonads, hormones, and genitalia. See, e.g., Am.
Psychological Ass’n, Answers to Your Questions About Transgender People, Gender Identity and Gender Expression at
1, http://www.apa.org/ topics/lgbt/transgender.pdf. “Sex is assigned at birth, refers to one’s biological status
as either male or female, and is associated primarily with physical attributes such as chromosomes, hormone
prevalence, and external and internal anatomy.”
Sex is NOT assigned ... I recommend referencing the American PSYCHIATRIC Association (DSM-5) instead:
The American Psychiatric Association defines sex as the &quot;biological indication of male and female (understood in
the context of reproductive capacity), such as sex chromosomes, gonads, sex hormones, and nonambiguous internal

and external genitalia.”
Reference:
American Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: DSM-5 (Washington, D.C.:
American Psychiatric Publishing, 2013), p. 829.
Best,

All,

Please meet Steve Smith, an Idaho allied attorney, and Idaho Representative Julianne Young. They have been working on a birth certificate protection bill, to reverse a recent court decision striking
down sex-based birth certificates in Idaho. This will restore the status quo, making Idaho one of four states that require birth certificates to reflect sex, along with Kansas, Ohio, and Tennessee.

Julianne has a short window to receive comments (especially desired from the medical experts).

Matt Sharp provided ADF factual findings for the recitals and some edits. I have accepted his changes; made a few suggested edits of my own, and thus open it up to you all for any input for Julianne and
Steve.

There may be an opportunity for expert testimony, but I leave the details on that to Rep. Young.

Thanks,

Seems reasonable as written.
What currently happens if a baby is born with ambiguous genitalia?
