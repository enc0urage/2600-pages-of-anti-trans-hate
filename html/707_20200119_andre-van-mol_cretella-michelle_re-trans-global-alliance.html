Fred and Michelle,
I understand. Fred has far and away done the heavy lifting on this fantastic project. I am completely
OK following the lead and rules he establishes. Alliances can be fragile and it’s best that, as this
bill goes, we stick to the small scope program in order to establish the greater goal.
As an aside, we have already seen Scott several times pigeonhole this bill into trans ideology with
glowing Pro trans language, aside from GAT in kids. Again, I think he’s a loose cannon. However ,
Fred, you know him better than anyone and I trust your judgment in getting this bill passed into law.

How&#x27;s it sound like that?
Cut your losses now, is my advice.

Walt Heyer and ex-transsexuals should be witnesses, not persons testifying that this
is medically necessary under the guise of gender.

​Dr. Cretella,
I&#x27;m going to respectfully disagree with that, and I&#x27;ll explain why.
I was recruited heavily by the Transsexual Global Alliance and I&#x27;ve largely
ignored them.
There&#x27;s no shortage of transsexuals willing to denounce the medicalization
of children, but their endorsements come with a hitch: they expect everyone
to play make believe that they really are the opposite sex and have
compelled pronouns and all that garbage. Even worse, they pitch themselves
as the real deal, the true transsexuals that had to transition. People like
me they claim have sexual paraphilias and fetishes, while they were born in
the wrong body.
So I encourage all of you to not buy into this Trojan Horse ploy, because
the actions of these folks &quot;identifying&quot; as the opposite sex is contributing
immensely to the harm being done to females. It&#x27;s part of our fight, in
fact.
Walt Heyer is proof that no matter how far you&#x27;ve gone medically, you can
still turn back.
So unless they&#x27;ve taken formal steps to reclaim their birth sex and denounce
gender ideology, please don&#x27;t endorse or indulge these persons.
Or contribute to the Blaire White types profiteering from this type of
behavior.

I am the only one on this panel that has medically transitioned and
it&#x27;s no place for a child. Some, very few, but some adults need to
transition to find peace, but no child should go through this.
8 months ago was the first time I was made aware that they were
doing this to kids and I was appalled.
I&#x27;m gathering more transgender adults quotes and thoughts on this
and you are just going to have to trust me..Most, trans adults feel
the way I do, they just are scared of coming out and saying it.
Please dont loose hope or strength toward this goal, this bill is
historic if it passes and it will be the starting point to saving
millions of kids. Please understand this, this will not end well if
this doesnt pass.

James,
You did not come off heavy handed - I am glad for your persistent explanation. I had to question timing and manner
due to political situation, but you were being transparent and truthful.
