Hi Grace,
Hi Grace,
I&#x27;m open to either, phone or meeting in person. I think meeting in person is a great idea because you&#x27;ll get a real world perspective on my challenges.

How would meeting in person work? Do I come to your office? Or will we be meeting somewhere else? I&#x27;m totally flexible.
