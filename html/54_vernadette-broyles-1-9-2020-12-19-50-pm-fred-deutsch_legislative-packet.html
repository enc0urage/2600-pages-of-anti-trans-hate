Dear Team
Attached, at long last, is a Legislative Packet of information and documents that Jane Robbins and I created, with
the help, review, and editing of Michelle, to be used in support of the Vulnerable Child Protection Acts being
introduced in our respective states.
In this arena there is such ignorance, and misinformation, about the issue of transgenderism that we felt that
legislators needed a primer to accurately understand it. We have received permission from the Minnesota Family
Institute to use Chapters 1 - 3 of the Parent Resource Guide as such a primer. We then created handouts on the
three key issues we know the other side is going to attack us on: 1) the suicide claim, 2) the claim that the
medical community widely supports these treatments, and 3) the bald-faced lie (weâ€™ve already seen in the media)
that these interventions are not happening in minors. Representative Ehrhart generously paid for the design work
for the handouts to have a similar look to the Parent Resource Guide. Finally, is a generic Whitepaper, based on the
SD and GA white papers we all worked on.
Our goal was to create a packet of information (well researched, full of citations, and formatted to catch the eye
with the major points) that will educate and inform our legislators and supporting organizations, but also will arm
them with ready answers for the major attacks of misinformation that will be thrown at them. Attached are the
following:

• Parent Resource Guide - Chaps. 1 - 3 primer on the transgender issue (please note, we do not have permission to bind this document with any of the others)
• Suicide handout
• Medical professionals handout
• Medical Interventions in minors handout
• Whitepaper (generic)

I would very much like to hear what you all think about these handouts and the packet they create. Please share these with your legislators and feel free disseminate them as
widely as possible with allies. We hope they become weapons in the hands of many warriors!
