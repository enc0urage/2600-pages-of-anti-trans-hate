Hi
This might be because of anti-bot detection (since Cloudflare
cancelled archive.is few days ago I had to make my own and it is far
from perfect). Tell me your IP or IP range to whitelist

&gt; Greetings,
&gt; There&#x27;s site errors going on for the past several hours. When a link is
&gt; requested to be archived it arrives to a blank page. Refreshing the page
&gt; still ends up blank. But after several minutes when the link is attempted
&gt; again, it says it&#x27;s already been archived. This occurred on several
&gt; different attempts to archive different news articles.
&gt; Thanks!
