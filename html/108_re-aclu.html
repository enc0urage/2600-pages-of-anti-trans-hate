Here&#x27;s your requested proof, Scott.
And I stand by what I said. Until you renounce that fake male identity, reclaim your female birth sex, and quit calling yourself Scott, my advice to leadership is you and all those like you get
canned from this endeavor.
The whole lot of you are like drug addicts with a syringe hanging out of your arms, while preaching: &quot;hey kids, this is harmful stuff, don&#x27;t be like us.&quot; You can do everything you&#x27;re doing now
as a female.
If you folks want to exercise adult autonomy and destroy your bodies under the pretense of being the &quot;real deal&quot; transsexual and under the guise of &quot;it&#x27;s transition or suicide&quot; and &quot;this is
medically necessary and insurance companies should pay for our surgeries,&quot; which are really lifestyle decisions in my view and based on my experience: go ahead. But don&#x27;t expect
society to get rewired to accommodate your cosmetically altered appearance and people to indulge your delusions about not being female, and religious folks to change their beliefs
based on biblical teachings.
I&#x27;ve said everything I need to say at this point.

I&#x27;m going to respectfully disagree with that, and I&#x27;ll explain why.

I was recruited heavily by the Transsexual Global Alliance and I&#x27;ve largely ignored them. I have never heard your name or ever considered reaching out to you

There&#x27;s no shortage of transsexuals willing to denounce ( publically, that is not true)the medicalization of children, but their endorsements come with a hitch: they expect everyone to play make believe that they really are the opposite sex and
have compelled pronouns and all that garbage. Even worse, they pitch themselves as the real deal, the true transsexuals that had to transition. People like me they claim have sexual paraphilias and fetishes, while they were born in the wrong

body.

I do not believe I am a biological male
I do not condone sexual paraphilias or fetishes or
I am not the pronoun police

Please send me a link to this organization you are speaking of because it&#x27;s definitely not mine.

So I encourage all of you to not buy into this Trojan Horse ploy, because the actions of these folks &quot;identifying&quot; as the opposite sex is contributing immensely to the harm being done to females. It&#x27;s part of our fight, in fact.

Walt Heyer is proof that no matter how far you&#x27;ve gone medically, you can still turn back.

So unless they&#x27;ve taken formal steps to reclaim their birth sex and denounce gender ideology, please don&#x27;t endorse or indulge these persons.

Or contribute to the Blaire White types profiteering from this type of behavior.
