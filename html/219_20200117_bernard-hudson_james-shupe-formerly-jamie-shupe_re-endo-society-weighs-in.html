Well, NYC CPS investigated a bizarre claim and did not find a problem:

Desmond is Amazing.

Dancing in front of drinking men, changing costumes, having cash placed in your panties, wearing make-up and a wig,
in a smoke filled room is NOT a problem in NYC!
Age?

I emailed each member of the steering committee of the ENDO 2020 meeting (the Endocrine Society&#x27;s
annual CME event) to suggest that they consider a broad, balanced presentation forum so that all
opinions about transgender care could be presented and debated. I was answered in an email from the
steering committee chairman that I should provide input to them sometime in April in planning for ENDO
2021 since they had already set this year&#x27;s agenda.
She listed the three talks planned- all by trans
affirmation folks- and told me to look for the announcement requesting suggestions for ENDO 2021. I
asked her to be sure to send me the notice personally since I had never received such a notice in May
of 2019 asking for input about topics for ENDO 2020. Mike- we need to be sure we both get in their
face for next year&#x27;s meeting and not let down.

Well Fred,

The Endocrine Society has jumped into the mix. I attached a screen shot.

Here is a link to my quick response.
