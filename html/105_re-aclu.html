Dr. Cretella,
I&#x27;m going to respectfully disagree with that, and I&#x27;ll explain why.
I was recruited heavily by the Transsexual Global Alliance and I&#x27;ve largely ignored them.
There&#x27;s no shortage of transsexuals willing to denounce the medicalization of children, but their endorsements come
with a hitch: they expect everyone to play make believe that they really are the opposite sex and have compelled
pronouns and all that garbage. Even worse, they pitch themselves as the real deal, the true transsexuals that had to
transition. People like me they claim have sexual paraphilias and fetishes, while they were born in the wrong body.
So I encourage all of you to not buy into this Trojan Horse ploy, because the actions of these folks &quot;identifying&quot;
as the opposite sex is contributing immensely to the harm being done to females. It&#x27;s part of our fight, in fact.
Walt Heyer is proof that no matter how far you&#x27;ve gone medically, you can still turn back.
So unless they&#x27;ve taken formal steps to reclaim their birth sex and denounce gender ideology, please don&#x27;t endorse
or indulge these persons.
Or contribute to the Blaire White types profiteering from this type of behavior.
James

I am the only one on this panel that has medically transitioned and it&#x27;s no place for a child. Some, very
few, but some adults need to transition to find peace, but no child should go through this.
8 months ago was the first time I was made aware that they were doing this to kids and I was appalled.
I&#x27;m gathering more transgender adults quotes and thoughts on this and you are just going to have to trust
me..Most, trans adults feel the way I do, they just are scared of coming out and saying it.
Please dont loose hope or strength toward this goal, this bill is historic if it passes and it will be the
starting point to saving millions of kids. Please understand this, this will not end well if this doesnt
pass.
