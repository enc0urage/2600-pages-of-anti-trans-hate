Brainstorming idea for objections to bill. Others that you think I should prepare for in addition claims that:

Suicide rates go up
Impact economy
Interferes with doctor-patient relationship
Interferes with parental rights
Parents must give consent â€“ therefore it should be the parent held responsible, not the doctor
PB are reversable
Bill is unconstitutional
