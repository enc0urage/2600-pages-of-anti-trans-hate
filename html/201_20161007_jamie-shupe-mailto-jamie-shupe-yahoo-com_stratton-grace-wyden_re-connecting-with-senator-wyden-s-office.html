Hi Grace,
I&#x27;m open to either, phone or meeting in person. I think meeting in person is a great idea because you&#x27;ll get a real world perspective on my challenges.
How would meeting in person work? Do I come to your office? Or will we be meeting somewhere else? I&#x27;m totally flexible.
My phone number is 503-964-4558.
Thanks so much!
Jamie Shupe
