Dr. Brook Jones needs to explain to South Dakota lawmakers why there are so many more young people who after
following the current Standards of Care set forth in Gender Clinics are &quot;coming out&quot; after transitioning saying the
doctors failed them because the hormones and surgery were totally unnecessary. I one case the doctors produced &quot;a
Frankenstein hack job&quot; this is where the LGBTQ Hippocratic Oath acatually works to undermine the lives of young
people. My article this year below

Passing along email from a pediatrician that was sent to all SD lawmakers. I asked Michelle to please pen a response so I can forward it to lawmakers. If any of the rest of you physicians feel
moved to respond, it will help the cause, as I will also forward to them. Lawmakers on the fence are moved by letters like this as it appears to come from an evidence-based perspective. We
need to be able to provide reasonable rebuttals. – Rep. Fred Deutsch

I am a Pediatrician and community member in South Dakota. I am writing today about my concerns about HB
1057, a bill that would criminalize doctors for performing gender-affirming, life-saving medical care
for transgender youth in our state.
The bill undermines my Hippocratic Oath that I took when I became a doctor, First Do No Harm. Current
standards of care for transgender youth and adolescents delays puberty until children are old enough to
make their own decisions about their lived gender. This bill would take away their choices, irreversibly
force them through puberty and undermine the prevailing recommendations of every major medical
association. The best practice in Pediatrics is for transgender and gender diverse individuals to have

access to comprehensive, gender-affirming, and developmentally appropriate health care. This bill goes
against evidence-based practice and discriminates against a vulnerable population. It puts children&#x27;s
safety at risk, as transgender youth have increased risk of social isolation, suicide, homelessness,
physical violence, and substance abuse, particularly when their gender identity is not supported.
I implore you to vote against this bill, or if you are supporting it, reconsider your position. I also
encourage you to get in contact with local physicians treating these youth, to continue the conversation
about how this bill will negatively affect the children that we serve.
Myself, and several other physicians will be at the Capitol on Wednesday, January 22, for Children’s
Day at the Capitol. I invite you to come to our catered breakfast in the President and Speaker lobbies
starting at 7:00 am, to have the opportunity to talk and ask questions about children’s health.
