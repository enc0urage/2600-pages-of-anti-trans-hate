Good evening, Jamie.
Itâ€™s an honor to make your e-quaintance. Your court proceedings I will keep confidential until you say otherwise.
Great to hear about the VA decision. I and several of our team separately wrote letters to the VA last year when
they requested public comment on proposed pro-trans changes. You are doing a mighty thing that will protect and save
many lives.
Gratefully,
Andre

Hi Jamie and Andre,
Jamie, I&#x27;m going to introduce you to another important person in our physician group, Dr. Andre Van Mol. He&#x27;s got a number of great writings as well, and we are periodically &quot;coconspirators&quot; at our capitol in California speaking out on trans madness.
Andre, you can see the email thread below.
Jamie, we&#x27;ll certainly keep quiet on your legal matters. Thanks for letting us know!
Mike

No worries, I can be slow figuring out whitty replies.
I look forward to everyone working together in the time ahead.
We have much to do and many challenges. But they can be overcome.

Oh, I&#x27;m sorry - I knew what you meant. I was trying to be funny as in &quot;I will keep it under my hat b/c I already forgot what you said&quot;.
My humor is not always clear over email.

Michelle,
I&#x27;m gonna try to get a judge to change my sex back to male. I was the first person in the U.S. to ever be declared legally non-binary.

You are awesome.
And I don&#x27;t know what you are talking about. :0)

Hello Michelle,
I&#x27;m equally honored to meet you as well.
Great news arrived in the mail today. The VA wrote sex change letters confirming that I am male and officially changing me back.
With that, the next move begins. To kill my landmark non-binary court order.
Keep that under your hats, for now, please, though.

Hello Michelle and Jamie,
Great pleasure to introduce Jamie Shupe to you Michelle. As you know he wrote the great federalist article and has also been making a lot of noise on Twitter. So they shut
him up! For now...
And Jamie, you know Dr. Michelle Cretella, she was also critical in helping us in Rocklin when they were pushing trans madness into our schools. And of course she has so many
great writings, videos, etc.
Mike
