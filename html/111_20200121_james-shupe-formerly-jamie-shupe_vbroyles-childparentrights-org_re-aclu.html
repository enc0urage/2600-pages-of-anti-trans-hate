I hope others will step forward and work hard to convince Fred he&#x27;s going to do serious damage putting a protransition transsexual on the stand that&#x27;s still identifying as a male.
Thanks for speaking up.

Jamie is right. Jane Robbins shares with me that last night a GA lawyer shared with her (after she spoke at a
gathering) that his former client is a trans-identified individual who had sued his employer baed on his trans
status -- and yet is still completely opposed to children going through these interventions.

And my twitter was shut down and my website was hacked.
I keep saying this, but I want to make sure that NONE of us lose sight to the children we are saving.
I am the only one on this panel that has medically transitioned and it&#x27;s no place for a child. Some, very
few, but some adults need to transition to find peace, but no child should go through this.
8 months ago was the first time I was made aware that they were doing this to kids and I was appalled.
I&#x27;m gathering more transgender adults quotes and thoughts on this and you are just going to have to trust
me..Most, trans adults feel the way I do, they just are scared of coming out and saying it.
Please dont loose hope or strength toward this goal, this bill is historic if it passes and it will be the
starting point to saving millions of kids. Please understand this, this will not end well if this doesnt
pass.

So the ACLU is giving out your home phone number, Fred?
“The time to act is now,” the ACLU of South Dakota tweeted. It followed with a long list of legislator’s home and office numbers.&quot;
