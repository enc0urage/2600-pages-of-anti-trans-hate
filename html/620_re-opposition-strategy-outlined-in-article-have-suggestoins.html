Yes, agree.
On the suicide argument:
South Dakota Kids who are suicidal need immediate and proper mental healthcare. Hormones and surgeries are not
mental healthcare at all, but in fact make the situation far worse.
We know that in the Uk’s Tavistock gender identity service kids on puberty blockers reported greater self harm and
girls exhibited more behavioral and emotional problems. [1]
High dose sex steroids like testosterone have been shown to lead to an increase in the presentation and severity of
psychiatric illness, including psychotic symptoms. [2]
And in Sweden, 30 years of population data of the entire nation showed that even after hormones and genital
surgeries the suicide rate was a massive 19 times higher than the general Swedish population. [3]
Read the labeling of the puberty blocker Lupron, there is a very clear warning:
&quot;Psychiatric events have been reported in patients taking GnRH agonists including LUPRON DEPOT-PED. Monitor for
development or worsening of psychiatric symptoms during treatment&quot;. [4]
These drugs and procedures are extremely hazardous for South Dakota kids. They will only add fuel to a very
dangerous fire.

No doctor or parent has a right to subject a child to a life-altering medical experiment with unknown long-term
consequences. Without this ban in place, SD will follow what is already happening in other states: minors who
successfully sue in court to obtain this supposedly &quot;life-saving&quot; medical intervention. And when they grow up
with irreversible regret, who will be liable? The state.
This ban is also important to prevent custody battles. We have several parents who have reached out to the KC
because of a former spouse who is intent on medicalizing their child. Finding an attorney to help is nearly as
difficult as finding a therapist. And even when they do, who knows how a judge will rule? Banning these
procedures will take these serious medical decisions away from misinformed judges.
The claim that this is lifesaving medically necessary intervention is the big unchallenged domino that is
driving both the legal and medical scandal. This is an oft-repeated claim with no support and it must be
confronted directly.

Mike,
Look at the medical claim in that &quot;legal&quot; ACLU quote; it is false on multiple grounds

&quot;no such thing as a medically diagnosable group of trans anybody; we are talking about minors! blockers, wrong
sex hormones and surgical mutilation are never medically necessary in minors!&quot;

Legal experts have an opinion on that statement?
