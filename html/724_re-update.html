Subject: Re: update

Understood, and I know exceptionally good attorneys have gone over and over this. It is very specific to perception
of sex, which is good. I also wondered about the need for such surgeries in trauma victims, but you also specified
non-diseased, so that would seem ok. Itâ€™s just that if we are a bit confused and have misgivings, one wonders what
the actual legislators will think. Perhaps part of the problem is we were dealing with the longer version for so
long that now seeing such a condensed bill seems a touch bewildering.

The key to the entire bill is the language â€œattempting to change or affirm the childâ€™s perception of their sex,â€​ with sex defined as â€œthe biological state of being female or male.â€​
We have to be able to explain the application.
So letâ€™s say we have a teenage girl:
1. She perceives she is a boy.
a. Doctors cannot perform any of the restricted surgical procedures or give restricted meds (PB &amp; cross-sex hormones) thataffirm her perception of being a boy.
b. Doctors cannot perform any of the restricted surgical procedures or give restricted meds (PB &amp; cross-sex hormones) thatchange her perception of being a boy. (Iâ€™m not sure this is
applicable. Thoughts?)
2. She perceives she is a girl.
a. Doctors cannot perform any of the restricted surgical procedures or give restricted meds (PB &amp; cross-sex hormones) thataffirm her perception of being a girl. (This scenario would
mean there is congruity between body and mind. Bill is probably not applicable).
b. Doctors cannot perform any of the restricted surgical procedures or give restricted meds (PB &amp; cross-sex hormones) thatchange her perception of being a girl. (This scenario would
mean there is congruity between body and mind. Bill is probably not applicable).
Please let me know what you think - Fred
