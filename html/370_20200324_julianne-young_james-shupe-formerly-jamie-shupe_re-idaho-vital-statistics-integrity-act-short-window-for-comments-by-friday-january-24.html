Okay, so first off, I&#x27;m grateful for your courage to do this bill because it&#x27;s a big strike in the right direction. I&#x27;m also saddened that you&#x27;re taking a lot of heat, but that was to be expected and you knew that was coming

So again, Fred, I am truly grateful for your hard work and willingness to do this because it&#x27;s put the language and framework into place for other states to hopefully be successful. I just hope they come at it differently.
