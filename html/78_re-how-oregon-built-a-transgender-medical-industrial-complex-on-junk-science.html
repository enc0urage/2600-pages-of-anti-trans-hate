Wow, excellent!
Something not mentioned is that in Portland a fellow who calls himself &quot;Jenn&quot; Burleton runs the &quot;TransActive Gender
Center,&quot; based at Lewis and Clark College. He has no professional qualifications, apart from serving as trombone
player in a warmed-over &quot;Up With People&quot; cohort in the &#x27;70s. Sadly, but perhaps not surprisingly for Portland these
days, people there tend to take him seriously. For many years Burleton has brought autogynephilic fanaticism to his
goal of transing children and teens at the earliest ages possible. I recall that he was interviewed when Oregon
lowered the age at which kids could be seduced into pointless maiming without telling their parents. It was clear
that Burleton had been lobbying extensively among that year&#x27;s crop of state legislators, most of whom were evidently
dunces. I&#x27;m sure that Burleton has pushed dozens if not hundreds of confused, mentally ill, vulnerable youth into
the bleak superficial translife of permanent patient-hood and obsessive mimicry.
All the best,
H.
